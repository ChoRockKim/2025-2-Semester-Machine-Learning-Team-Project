Network immunization and virus propagation in email networks: experimental evaluation and analysis,"Network immunization strategies have emerged as possible solutions to the challenges of virus propagation. In this paper, an existing interactive model is introduced and then improved in order to better characterize the way a virus spreads in email networks with different topologies. The model is used to demonstrate the effects of a number of key factors, notably nodes’ degree and betweenness. Experiments are then performed to examine how the structure of a network and human dynamics affects virus propagation. The experimental results have revealed that a virus spreads in two distinct phases and shown that the most efficient immunization strategy is the node-betweenness strategy. Moreover, those results have also explained why old virus can survive in networks nowadays from the aspects of human dynamics.",0,"Network immunization and virus propagation in email networks: experimental evaluation and analysis Network immunization strategies have emerged as possible solutions to the challenges of virus propagation.

Comparing MMPI-2-Restructured Form Scores by Service Era for Veterans Assessed Within the Veteran Affairs Healthcare System,"This study compares profiles of Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) scale scores from 1492 VA test-takers who served during the Vietnam or Gulf War service eras. The sample includes all such cases collected at any VA posttraumatic stress disorder Clinical Teams across the United States between January 1, 2008 and May 31, 2015 using the MMPI-2 or MMPI-2-RF (via the VA Mental Health Assistant suite). Associations between gender and score differences were also examined. In contrast to past research using the MMPI-2, results of this study suggest that veterans are generally homogeneous in their MMPI-2-RF profiles across different periods of service. Specifically, the magnitudes of mean differences are small and not clinically significant. Thus, responses on the MMPI-2-RF do not appear influenced by service era.

Compatibility and Safety Implications Associated with Interfacing Medical Devices in Neonatal Respiratory Care: A Case Example Using the Inhaled Nitric Oxide Delivery System,"Over the past decade, international organizations have instituted strict regulations for the safe use of connected medical devices. The International Organization for Standardization and the Medical Device Single Audit Program instituted certifications to ensure that connected devices are compatible and operate within their proper clinical parameters. These efforts came about, in part, as a consequence of clinicians’ decisions to use nonstandard, modified, or improvised devices for purposes outside the original manufacturers’ approved parameters. Unapproved device modifications can be associated with increased risk of dosing errors, monitoring errors, tubing misconnections and serious or potentially fatal adverse events; furthermore, health care providers who implement unapproved device modifications may assume legal and financial liability should harm come to patients as a consequence of the modification. Using the inhaled nitric oxide delivery system as an example, the objective of this paper is to raise awareness of the potential dangers associated with unapproved modification and interfacing of therapeutic gas delivery systems and ventilators in the neonatal intensive care unit setting. The paper also highlights the rationale and necessity for rigorous validation processes that ensure that interfaced medical devices perform as intended in the clinical setting.",0,"Compatibility and Safety Implications Associated with Interfacing Medical Devices in Neonatal Respiratory Care: A Case Example Using the Inhaled Nitric Oxide Delivery System Over the past decade, international organizations have instituted strict regulations for the safe use of connected medical devices.

The socio-economic distribution of exposure to Ebola: Survey evidence from Liberia and Sierra Leone,"Socio-economic factors are widely believed to have been an important driver of the transmission of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the West African outbreak of 2014–16, however, studies that have investigated the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and EVD have found inconsistent results. Using nationally representative household survey data on whether respondents knew a close friend or family member with Ebola, we explore the SES determinants of EVD exposure along individual, household, and community lines in Liberia and Sierra Leone. While we find no overall association between household wealth and EVD exposure, we find that pooled data mask important differences observed within countries with higher wealth households more likely to have been exposed to EVD in Sierra Leone and the opposite relationship in Liberia. Finally, we also generally find a positive association between education and EVD exposure both at the individual and the community levels in the full sample. There is an urgent need to better understand these relationships to examine both why the outbreak spread and to help prepare for future outbreaks.",0,"The socio-economic distribution of exposure to Ebola: Survey evidence from Liberia and Sierra Leone Socio-economic factors are widely believed to have been an important driver of the transmission of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the West African outbreak of 2014–16, however, studies that have investigated the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and EVD have found inconsistent results.

Stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting by RNA G-quadruplex structures,"Guanine-rich sequences can fold into four-stranded structures of stacked guanine-tetrads, so-called G-quadruplexes (G4). These unique motifs have been extensively studied on the DNA level; however, exploration of the biological roles of G4s at the RNA level is just emerging. Here we show that G4 RNA when introduced within coding regions are capable of stimulating −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 FS) in vitro and in cultured cells. Systematic manipulation of the loop length between each G-tract revealed that the −1 FS efficiency positively correlates with G4 stability. Addition of a G4-stabilizing ligand, PhenDC3, resulted in higher −1 FS. Further, we demonstrated that the G4s can stimulate +1 FS and stop codon readthrough as well. These results suggest a potentially novel translational gene regulation mechanism mediated by G4 RNA.",0,"Stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting by RNA G-quadruplex structures Guanine-rich sequences can fold into four-stranded structures of stacked guanine-tetrads, so-called G-quadruplexes (G4).

Coordination among tertiary base pairs results in an efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot,"Frameshifting is an essential process that regulates protein synthesis in many viruses. The ribosome may slip backward when encountering a frameshift motif on the messenger RNA, which usually contains a pseudoknot structure involving tertiary base pair interactions. Due to the lack of detailed molecular explanations, previous studies investigating which features of the pseudoknot are important to stimulate frameshifting have presented diverse conclusions. Here we constructed a bimolecular pseudoknot to dissect the interior tertiary base pairs and used single-molecule approaches to assess the structure targeted by ribosomes. We found that the first ribosome target stem was resistant to unwinding when the neighboring loop was confined along the stem; such constrained conformation was dependent on the presence of consecutive adenosines in this loop. Mutations that disrupted the distal base triples abolished all remaining tertiary base pairs. Changes in frameshifting efficiency correlated with the stem unwinding resistance. Our results demonstrate that various tertiary base pairs are coordinated inside a highly efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot and suggest a mechanism by which mechanical resistance of the pseudoknot may persistently act on translocating ribosomes.",0,"Coordination among tertiary base pairs results in an efficient frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot Frameshifting is an essential process that regulates protein synthesis in many viruses.

Assessing the stability of biobank donor preferences regarding sample use: evidence supporting the value of dynamic consent,"Dynamic consent has been proposed as a strategy for addressing the limitations of traditional, broad consent for biobank participation. Although the argument for dynamic consent has been made on theoretical grounds, empirical studies evaluating the potential utility of dynamic consent are needed to enhance deliberations about the merits of dynamic consent. Few studies have assessed such considerations as whether donor preferences may change over time or if participants would use a dynamic consent mechanism to modify preferences when they change. We administered a 66-item survey to participants in a large DNA biobank. The survey sought to gauge the stability of donor preferences specified at the time of biobank enrollment, specifically the stability of donors’ preference regarding posthumous availability of biospecimens to next-of-kin. We received 1164 completed surveys for a response rate of 72%. Forty percent of respondents indicated a preference regarding sample availability on the survey (T2) that was inconsistent with the preference they had expressed when they enrolled in the biobank (T1). Most (94%) individuals with inconsistent preferences regarding sample availability had initially restricted sample availability at T1 but were comfortable with broader availability when asked at the time of the survey (T2). Our findings demonstrate that preferences regarding sample use expressed at the time of enrollment in a DNA biobank may not be reliable indicators of donor preferences over time. These findings lend empirical support to the case for a dynamic consent model in which biobank participants are approached over time to clarify their views regarding sample use.",0,"Assessing the stability of biobank donor preferences regarding sample use: evidence supporting the value of dynamic consent Dynamic consent has been proposed as a strategy for addressing the limitations of traditional, broad consent for biobank participation.

Strategies for having a more effective and less toxic CAR T-cell therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"In the recent years, using genetically modified T cells has been known as a rapid developing therapeutic approach due to the heartwarming results of clinical trials with patients suffering from relapsed or refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies such as R/R Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (R/R ALL). One of these renowned approaches is Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs are synthetic receptors with the ability to be expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and are specifically designed to target a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) of interest. CAR-expressing T cells have the capability of proliferating and maintaining their immunological functionality in the recipient body but like any other therapeutic approach, the safety, effectiveness, and specificity enhancement of CAR T cells still lingers in the ambiguity arena. Genetic manipulation methods, expansion protocols, infusion dosage, and conditioning regimens are all among crucial factors which can affect the efficacy of CAR T cell-based cancer therapy. In this article, we discuss the studies that have focused on various aspects that affect the efficacy and persistence of CAR T-cell therapy for ALL treatment and provide a widespread overview regarding the practical approaches capable of elevating the effectiveness and lessening the relative toxicities attributed to it.",0,"Strategies for having a more effective and less toxic CAR T-cell therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia In the recent years, using genetically modified T cells has been known as a rapid developing therapeutic approach due to the heartwarming results of clinical trials with patients suffering from relapsed or refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies such as R/R Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (R/R ALL).

A classification scheme for agent based approaches to dynamic optimization,"Several papers in the literature employ agent-based modeling approach for providing reasonable solutions to dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). However, these studies employ a variety of agent-based modeling approaches with different strategies and features for different DOPs. On the other hand, there is an absence in the literature of a formal representation of the existing agent-based solution strategies. This paper proposes a representation scheme indicating how the solution strategies with agent-based approach can be summarized in a concise manner. We present these in a tabular form called “Agent Based Dynamic Optimization Problem Solution Strategy” (ABDOPSS). ABDOPSS distinguishes different classes of agent based algorithms (via communication type, cooperation type, dynamism domain and etc.) by specifying the fundamental ingredients of each of these approaches with respect to problem domain (problems with dynamic objective functions, constraints and etc.). This paper also analyzes 18 generic studies in the literature employing agent-based modeling based on ABDOPSS.",0,"A classification scheme for agent based approaches to dynamic optimization Several papers in the literature employ agent-based modeling approach for providing reasonable solutions to dynamic optimization problems (DOPs).

Immunogenicity Challenges Associated with Subcutaneous Delivery of Therapeutic Proteins,"The subcutaneous route of administration has provided convenient and non-inferior delivery of therapeutic proteins compared to intravenous infusion, but there is potential for enhanced immunogenicity toward subcutaneously administered proteins in a subset of patients. Unwanted anti-drug antibody response toward proteins or monoclonal antibodies upon repeated administration is shown to impact the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple biologics. Unique immunogenicity challenges of the subcutaneous route have been realized through various preclinical and clinical examples, although subcutaneous delivery has often demonstrated comparable immunogenicity to intravenous administration. Beyond route of administration as a treatment-related factor of immunogenicity, certain product-related risk factors are particularly relevant to subcutaneously administered proteins. This review attempts to provide an overview of the mechanism of immune response toward proteins administered subcutaneously (subcutaneous proteins) and comments on product-related risk factors related to protein structure and stability, dosage form, and aggregation. A two-wave mechanism of antigen presentation in the immune response toward subcutaneous proteins is described, and interaction with dynamic antigen-presenting cells possessing high antigen processing efficiency and migratory activity may drive immunogenicity. Mitigation strategies for immunogenicity are discussed, including those in general use clinically and those currently in development.

Respiratory Virus Co-infection in Acute Respiratory Infections in Children,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This investigation aims to understand the role and burden of viral co-infections for acute respiratory illnesses in children. Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial and with new technology there is more information on the role they play on the health of children. RECENT FINDINGS: With the proliferation of multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well as innovations on identification of bacterial infections, research has been attempting to discover how these co-infections affect each other and the host. Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. SUMMARY: RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions.",0,"Respiratory Virus Co-infection in Acute Respiratory Infections in Children PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This investigation aims to understand the role and burden of viral co-infections for acute respiratory illnesses in children.

Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. SUMMARY: RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions.",respiratori viru acut respiratori infect children purpos review investig aim understand role burden viral acut respiratori ill children either new technolog inform role play health children recent find prolifer multiplex pcr rapid diagnosi multipl virus well innov identif bacteri infect research attempt discov affect host studi aim discern epidemiolog virus seen popul level relat interact differ virus host level studi also attempt discov burden morbid mortal pediatr popul also becom import understand interplay certain virus specif bacteria understand impact summari rsv continu contribut larg burden diseas pediatr patient acut respiratori ill howev recent literatur suggest add burden might case protect sever diseas hand like ad burden morbid pediatr patient synergist way infect nasopharyng space futur research need focu confirm conclus could affect hospit cohort role molecular test therapeut intervent,1
Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Among Intimate Partners During the Perinatal Period: A Narrative Literature Review,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects individuals and families from all backgrounds, regardless of their ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, or religion. Pregnancy and childbirth could be a time of vulnerability to violence because of changes in physical, emotional, social, and economic demands and needs. Prevalence of IPV against women during the perinatal period is increasingly researched and documented. However, evidence on IPV prevalence among intimate partners as well as on the course of IPV over the perinatal period is scarce. The purpose of this review was to provide a narrative synthesis of the existing literature regarding the prevalence estimates of IPV among intimate partners over the perinatal period. Through this review, we also gained better insight into associated factors, as well as the various forms of IPV. Of the 766 studies assessing prevalence estimates identified, 86 were included, where 80 studies focused on unidirectional IPV (i.e., perpetrated by men against women) and six studies investigated bidirectional IPV (i.e., IPV perpetrated by both partners). Most of the included studies reported lower overall prevalence rates for unidirectional IPV postpartum (range: 2–58%) compared to pregnancy (range: 1.5–66.9%). Psychological violence was found to be the most prevalent form of violence during the entire perinatal period. Studies on bidirectional IPV mostly reported women's perpetration to be almost as high as that of their partner or even higher, yet their findings need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, our results also highlighted the associated factors of IPV among partners, in which they were assimilated into a multi-level ecological model and were analyzed through an intersectional framework. Based on our findings, IPV is found to be highly prevalent during the entire perinatal period and in populations suffering from social inequalities. Further research exploring not only the occurrence, but also the motivations and the context of the bidirectionality of IPV during the perinatal period may facilitate better understanding of the detrimental consequences on partners and their families, as well as the development of effective intervention strategies. Public health prevention approaches intervening at optimal times during the perinatal period are also needed.",0,"Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Among Intimate Partners During the Perinatal Period: A Narrative Literature Review Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects individuals and families from all backgrounds, regardless of their ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, or religion.

Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease by Time-Dependent Power Spectrum Descriptors and Convolutional Neural Network Using EEG Signal,"Using strategies that obtain biomarkers where early symptoms coincide, the early detection of Alzheimer's disease and its complications is essential. Electroencephalogram is a technology that allows thousands of neurons with equal spatial orientation of the duration of cerebral cortex electrical activity to be registered by postsynaptic potential. Therefore, in this paper, the time-dependent power spectrum descriptors are used to diagnose the electroencephalogram signal function from three groups: mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy control test samples. The final feature used in three modes of traditional classification methods is recorded: k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis approaches, and documented results. Finally, for Alzheimer's disease patient classification, the convolutional neural network architecture is presented. The results are indicated using output assessment. For the convolutional neural network approach, the accurate meaning of accuracy is 82.3%. 85% of mild cognitive impairment cases are accurately detected in-depth, but 89.1% of the Alzheimer's disease and 75% of the healthy population are correctly diagnosed. The presented convolutional neural network outperforms other approaches because performance and the k-nearest neighbors' approach is the next target.

Offline World: the Internet as Social Infrastructure among the Unconnected in Quasi-Rural Illinois,"The United States continues to experience a persistent rural-urban digital divide. However, in this area of research, less attention has been paid to the divide in regions between these two demographic and geographic extremes. In this paper, we examine the perceived effects of internet inaccessibility in this in-between space, which we term “quasi-rural.” Using quasi-rural Illinois as a case study, semi-structured interview data is used to highlight the experiences of those who are directly affected by the digital divide, as well as those who provide service alternatives and advocate for internet connectivity. With this data, we describe the personal experience of at-home internet inaccessibility. We then focus on how limited, or a lack of access shapes the perceptions of community connectedness and disadvantage among those affected by the divide. Our findings demonstrate the internet’s function as social infrastructure; differences in access are then conceptualized as a form of socioeconomic inequality.",0,"Offline World: the Internet as Social Infrastructure among the Unconnected in Quasi-Rural Illinois The United States continues to experience a persistent rural-urban digital divide.

Beyond the pan-genome: current perspectives on the functional and practical outcomes of the distributed genome hypothesis,"The principle of monoclonality with regard to bacterial infections was considered immutable prior to 30 years ago. This view, espoused by Koch for acute infections, has proven inadequate regarding chronic infections as persistence requires multiple forms of heterogeneity among the bacterial population. This understanding of bacterial plurality emerged from a synthesis of what-were-then novel technologies in molecular biology and imaging science. These technologies demonstrated that bacteria have complex life cycles, polymicrobial ecologies, and evolve in situ via the horizontal exchange of genic characters. Thus, there is an ongoing generation of diversity during infection that results in far more highly complex microbial communities than previously envisioned. This perspective is based on the fundamental tenet that the bacteria within an infecting population display genotypic diversity, including gene possession differences, which result from horizontal gene transfer mechanisms including transformation, conjugation, and transduction. This understanding is embodied in the concepts of the supragenome/pan-genome and the distributed genome hypothesis (DGH). These paradigms have fostered multiple researches in diverse areas of bacterial ecology including host–bacterial interactions covering the gamut of symbiotic relationships including mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. With regard to the human host, within each of these symbiotic relationships all bacterial species possess attributes that contribute to colonization and persistence; those species/strains that are pathogenic also encode traits for invasion and metastases. Herein we provide an update on our understanding of bacterial plurality and discuss potential applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccinology based on perspectives provided by the DGH with regard to the evolution of pathogenicity.",0,"Beyond the pan-genome: current perspectives on the functional and practical outcomes of the distributed genome hypothesis The principle of monoclonality with regard to bacterial infections was considered immutable prior to 30 years ago.

Relative effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapeutic agents for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: a protocol for a multicentre comparative effectiveness study (CANRxPDA),"INTRODUCTION: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiovascular problem that develops in preterm infants and evidence regarding the best treatment approach is lacking. Currently available medical options to treat a PDA include indomethacin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Wide variation exists in PDA treatment practices across Canada. In view of this large practice variation across Canadian neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), we plan to conduct a comparative effectiveness study of the different pharmacotherapeutic agents used to treat the PDA in preterm infants. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre prospective observational comparative-effectiveness research study of extremely preterm infants born <29 weeks gestational age with an echocardiography confirmed PDA will be conducted. All participating sites will self-select and adhere to one of the following primary pharmacotherapy protocols for all preterm babies who are deemed to require treatment. 1. Standard dose ibuprofen (10 mg/kg followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg at 24 hours intervals) irrespective of postnatal age (oral/intravenous). 2. Adjustable dose ibuprofen (oral/intravenous) (10 mg/kg followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg at 24 hours intervals if treated within the first 7 days after birth. Higher doses of ibuprofen up to 20 mg/kg followed by two doses of 10 mg/kg at 24 hours intervals if treated after the postnatal age cut-off for lower dose as per the local centre policy). 3. Acetaminophen (oral/intravenous) (15 mg/kg every 6 hours) for 3–7 days. 4. Intravenous indomethacin (0.1–0.3 mg/kg intravenous every 12–24 hours for a total of three doses). OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is failure of primary pharmacotherapy (defined as need for further medical and/or surgical/interventional treatment following an initial course of pharmacotherapy). The secondary outcomes include components of the primary outcome as well as clinical outcomes related to response to treatment or adverse effects of treatment. SITES AND SAMPLE SIZE: The study will be conducted in 22 NICUs across Canada with an anticipated enrollment of 1350 extremely preterm infants over 3 years. ANALYSIS: To examine the relative effectiveness of the four treatment strategies, the primary outcome will be compared pairwise between the treatment groups using χ(2) test. Secondary outcomes will be compared pairwise between the treatment groups using χ(2) test, Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. To further examine differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the four groups, multiple logistic or linear regression models will be applied for each outcome on the treatment groups, adjusted for potential confounders using generalised estimating equations to account for within-unit-clustering. As a sensitivity analysis, the difference in the primary and secondary outcomes between the treatment groups will also be examined using propensity score method with inverse probability weighting approach.

The Impact of Farmers’ Strategic Behavior on the Spread of Animal Infectious Diseases,"One of the main strategies to control the spread of infectious animal diseases is the implementation of movement restrictions. This paper shows a loss in efficiency of the movement restriction policy (MRP) when behavioral responses of farmers are taken into account. Incorporating the strategic behavior of farmers in an epidemiologic model reveals that the MRP can trigger premature animal sales by farms at high risk of becoming infected that significantly reduce the efficacy of the policy. The results are validated in a parameterized network via Monte Carlo simulations and measures to mitigate the loss of efficiency of the MRP are discussed. Financial aid to farmers can be justified by public health concerns, not only for equity.

"Effects of larval exposure to sublethal doses of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis on body size, oviposition and survival of adult Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes","BACKGROUND: Application of the larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) is a viable complementary strategy for malaria control. Efficacy of Bti is dose-dependent. There is a knowledge gap on the effects of larval exposure to sublethal Bti doses on emerging adult mosquitoes. The present study examined the effect of larval exposure to sublethal doses of Bti on the survival, body size and oviposition rate in adult Anopheles coluzzii. METHODS: Third-instar An. coluzzii larvae were exposed to control and sublethal Bti concentrations at LC(20), LC(50) and LC(70) for 48 h. Surviving larvae were reared to adults under standard colony conditions. Thirty randomly selected females from each treatment were placed in separate cages and allowed to blood feed. Twenty-five gravid females from the blood-feeding cages were randomly selected and transferred into new cages where they were provided with oviposition cups. Numbers of eggs laid in each cage and mortality of all adult mosquitoes were recorded daily. Wing lengths were measured of 570 mosquitoes as a proxy for body size. RESULTS: Exposure to LC(70)Bti doses for 48 h as third-instar larvae reduced longevity of adult An. coluzzii mosquitoes. Time to death was 2.58 times shorter in females exposed to LC(70)Bti when compared to the control females. Estimated mortality hazard rates were also higher in females exposed to the LC(50) and LC(20) treatments, but these differences were not statistically significant. The females exposed to LC(70) concentrations had 12% longer wings than the control group (P < 0.01). No differences in oviposition rate of the gravid females were observed between the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of An. coluzzii larvae to sublethal Bti doses reduces longevity of resultant adults and is associated with larger adult size and unclear effect on oviposition. These findings suggest that anopheline larval exposure to sublethal Bti doses, though not recommended, could reduce vectorial capacity for malaria vector populations by increasing mortality of resultant adults.

"Prevalence of depression, anxiety and associated factors among school going adolescents in Bangladesh: Findings from a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders in early life represent a major concern as they become more complex and intense with transition into adolescence. Despite global recognition of the significance of adolescent mental health, it remains a neglected area in research and health policy in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety among school going adolescents in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 563 students aged 13–18 years at selected schools (secondary and higher secondary) in Dhaka City. After providing written informed consent, participants completed a survey examining socio-demographic variables, along with the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between variables under examination. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of moderate to severe levels of depression and anxiety were 26.5% and 18.1%, respectively. Based on multivariable analyses, unsatisfactory sleep (AOR = 3.17; 95% CI = 1.81–5.53, p < .001), cigarette smoking (AOR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.01–3.97, p = .048), and anxiety (AOR = 10.47; 95% CI = 6.11–17.95, p < .001) were associated with depression. Anxiety was associated with being 15–16 years (AOR = 2.66; 95% CI = 1.18–6.00, p = .018), not having good perceived relationships with friends (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.24–3.56, p = .006) and depression (AOR = 10.22; 95% CI = 6.01–17.38, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Depression and anxiety were prevalent among school going adolescents in Bangladesh. The findings suggest epidemiological data can direct policy-level decisions regarding evaluation, prevention, and intervention of mental health conditions among school going adolescents in Bangladesh.",0,"Prevalence of depression, anxiety and associated factors among school going adolescents in Bangladesh: Findings from a cross-sectional study BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders in early life represent a major concern as they become more complex and intense with transition into adolescence.

Oxidative Stress in Canine Histiocytic Sarcoma Cells Induced by an Infection with Canine Distemper Virus Led to a Dysregulation of HIF-1α Downstream Pathway Resulting in a Reduced Expression of VEGF-B In Vitro,"Histiocytic sarcomas represent malignant tumors which require new treatment strategies. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a promising candidate due to its oncolytic features reported in a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82 cells). Interestingly, the underlying mechanism might include a dysregulation of angiogenesis. Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of a persistent CDV-infection on oxidative stress mediated changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and its angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82 cells in vitro. Microarray data analysis, immunofluorescence for 8-hydroxyguanosine, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase, and flow cytometry for oxidative burst displayed an increased oxidative stress in persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells (DH82Ond pi) compared to controls. The HIF-1α expression in DH82Ond pi increased, as demonstrated by Western blot, and showed an unexpected, often sub-membranous distribution, as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, microarray data analysis and immunofluorescence confirmed a reduced expression of VEGF-B in DH82Ond pi compared to controls. In summary, these results suggest a reduced activation of the HIF-1α angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82Ond pi cells in vitro, most likely due to an excessive, unusually localized, and non-functional expression of HIF-1α triggered by a CDV-induced increased oxidative stress.",0,"Oxidative Stress in Canine Histiocytic Sarcoma Cells Induced by an Infection with Canine Distemper Virus Led to a Dysregulation of HIF-1α Downstream Pathway Resulting in a Reduced Expression of VEGF-B In Vitro Histiocytic sarcomas represent malignant tumors which require new treatment strategies.

Genomic Epidemiology Analysis of Infectious Disease Outbreaks Using TransPhylo,"Comparing the pathogen genomes from several cases of an infectious disease has the potential to help us understand and control outbreaks. Many methods exist to reconstruct a phylogeny from such genomes, which represents how the genomes are related to one another. However, such a phylogeny is not directly informative about transmission events between individuals. TransPhylo is a software tool implemented as an R package designed to bridge the gap between pathogen phylogenies and transmission trees. TransPhylo is based on a combined model of transmission between hosts and pathogen evolution within each host. It can simulate both phylogenies and transmission trees jointly under this combined model. TransPhylo can also reconstruct a transmission tree based on a dated phylogeny, by exploring the space of transmission trees compatible with the phylogeny. A transmission tree can be represented as a coloring of a phylogeny where each color represents a different host of the pathogen, and TransPhylo provides convenient ways to plot these colorings and explore the results. This article presents the basic protocols that can be used to make the most of TransPhylo. © 2021 The Authors.

"The impact of obesity on seasonal influenza: a single-center, retrospective study conducted in Israel","Obesity is associated with an increased susceptibility to infections. Several studies have reported adverse clinical outcomes of influenza among obese individuals. Our aim was to examine the association between obesity and the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adult patients ill with seasonal influenza. Consecutive hospitalized adult patients between 10/2017 and 4/2018 with laboratory confirmed influenza A and B were divided into an obese group (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and controls. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of 30-day all-cause mortality, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and severe influenza complication (myocarditis and encephalitis). Secondary outcomes encompassed all the components of the primary outcome, 90-day all-cause mortality, occurrence of pneumonia, length of hospital stay, and 90-day readmission rates. The study comprised 512 hospitalized adults diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (195/512) and B (317/512). Within this group, 17% (86/512) were classified obese; the remaining 83% (426/512) were controls. Results of the composite outcome (7/85, 8% vs. 45/422, 11%; p=0.5) and the crude 30-day all-cause mortality rate (5/86, 6% vs. 34/426, 8%, p=0.5) were similar between the two groups. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that obesity was not a significant risk factor for influenza adverse events (OR=1.3, CI 95% 0.3–3.3; p=0.5), whereas advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and hypoalbuminemia were significant risk factors (OR=1.03, OR=2.7, and OR=5.4, respectively).

Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Evolution: Exploring Pathways Towards Virus Extinction,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is genetically and phenotypically variable. As a typical RNA virus, FMDV follows a quasispecies dynamics, with the many biological implications of such a dynamics. Mutant spectra provide a reservoir of FMDV variants, and minority subpopulations may become dominant in response to environmental demands or as a result of statistical fluctuations in population size. Accumulation of mutations in the FMDV genome occurs upon subjecting viral populations to repeated bottleneck events and upon viral replication in the presence of mutagenic base or nucleoside analogs. During serial bottleneck passages, FMDV survive during extended rounds of replication maintaining low average relative fitness, despite linear accumulation of mutations in the consensus genomic sequence. The critical event is the occurrence of a low frequency of compensatory mutations. In contrast, upon replication in the presence of mutagens, the complexity of mutant spectra increases, apparently no compensatory mutations can express their fitness-enhancing potential, and the virus can cross an error threshold for maintenance of genetic information, resulting in virus extinction. Low relative fitness and low viral load favor FMDV extinction in cell culture. The comparison of the molecular basis of resistance to extinction upon bottleneck passage and extinction by enhanced mutagenesis is providing new insights in the understanding of quasispecies dynamics. Such a comparison is contributing to the development of new antiviral strategies based on the transition of viral replication into error catastrophe.",0,"Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Evolution: Exploring Pathways Towards Virus Extinction Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is genetically and phenotypically variable.

A System Dynamics Simulation Applied to Healthcare: A Systematic Review,"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing system dynamics simulation models to analyze complex healthcare problems. However, there is a lack of studies seeking to summarize the available papers in healthcare and present evidence on the effectiveness of system dynamics simulation in this area. The present paper draws on a systematic selection of published literature from 2000 to 2019, in order to form a comprehensive view of current applications of system dynamics methodology that address complex healthcare issues. The results indicate that the application of system dynamics has attracted significant attention from healthcare researchers since 2013. To date, articles on system dynamics have focused on a variety of healthcare topics. The most popular research areas among the reviewed papers included the topics of patient flow, obesity, workforce demand, and HIV/AIDS. Finally, the quality of the included papers was assessed based on a proposed ranking system, and ways to improve the system dynamics models’ quality were discussed.",0,"A System Dynamics Simulation Applied to Healthcare: A Systematic Review In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing system dynamics simulation models to analyze complex healthcare problems.

"Current accounts of antimicrobial resistance: stabilisation, individualisation and antibiotics as infrastructure","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the latest issues to galvanise political and financial investment as an emerging global health threat. This paper explores the construction of AMR as a problem, following three lines of analysis. First, an examination of some of the ways in which AMR has become an object for action—through defining, counting and projecting it. Following Lakoff’s work on emerging infectious diseases, the paper illustrates that while an ‘actuarial’ approach to AMR may be challenging to stabilise due to definitional and logistical issues, it has been successfully stabilised through a ‘sentinel’ approach that emphasises the threat of AMR. Second, the paper draws out a contrast between the way AMR is formulated in terms of a problem of connectedness—a ‘One Health’ issue—and the frequent solutions to AMR being focused on individual behaviour. The paper suggests that AMR presents an opportunity to take seriously connections, scale and systems but that this effort is undermined by the prevailing tendency to reduce health issues to matters for individual responsibility. Third, the paper takes AMR as a moment of infrastructural inversion (Bowker and Star) when antimicrobials and the work they do are rendered more visible. This leads to the proposal of antibiotics as infrastructure—part of the woodwork that we take for granted, and entangled with our ways of doing life, in particular modern life. These explorations render visible the ways social, economic and political frames continue to define AMR and how it may be acted upon, which opens up possibilities for reconfiguring AMR research and action.",0,"Current accounts of antimicrobial resistance: stabilisation, individualisation and antibiotics as infrastructure Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the latest issues to galvanise political and financial investment as an emerging global health threat.

Following Lakoff’s work on emerging infectious diseases, the paper illustrates that while an ‘actuarial’ approach to AMR may be challenging to stabilise due to definitional and logistical issues, it has been successfully stabilised through a ‘sentinel’ approach that emphasises the threat of AMR. Second, the paper draws out a contrast between the way AMR is formulated in terms of a problem of connectedness—a ‘One Health’ issue—and the frequent solutions to AMR being focused on individual behaviour. The paper suggests that AMR presents an opportunity to take seriously connections, scale and systems but that this effort is undermined by the prevailing tendency to reduce health issues to matters for individual responsibility. Third, the paper takes AMR as a moment of infrastructural inversion (Bowker and Star) when antimicrobials and the work they do are rendered more visible. This leads to the proposal of antibiotics as infrastructure—part of the woodwork that we take for granted, and entangled with our ways of doing life, in particular modern life. These explorations render visible the ways social, economic and political frames continue to define AMR and how it may be acted upon, which opens up possibilities for reconfiguring AMR research and action.",current account antimicrobi resist stabilis individualis antibiot infrastructur antimicrobi resist amr one latest issu galvanis polit financi invest emerg global health threat paper explor construct amr problem follow three line analysi first examin way amr becom object defin count project follow lakoff work emerg infecti diseas paper illustr actuari approach amr may challeng stabilis due definit logist issu success stabilis sentinel approach emphasis threat amr second paper draw contrast way amr formul term problem one health frequent solut amr focus individu behaviour paper suggest amr present opportun take serious connect scale system effort undermin prevail tendenc reduc health issu matter individu respons third paper take amr moment infrastructur invers bowker star antimicrobi work render visibl lead propos antibiot woodwork take grant entangl way life particular modern life explor render visibl way social econom polit frame continu defin amr may act upon open possibl reconfigur amr research action,1
Tumor-Treating Fields Induce RAW264.7 Macrophage Activation Via NK-κB/MAPK Signaling Pathways,"OBJECTIVE: Tumor-treating fields are currently used to successfully treat various cancers; however, the specific pathways associated with its efficacy remain unknown in the immune responses. Here, we evaluated tumor-treating fields–mediated initiation of the macrophage-specific immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We subjected RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages to clinically relevant levels of tumor-treating fields (0.9 V/cm, 150 kHz) and evaluated alterations in cytokine expression and release, as well as cell viability. Additionally, we investigated the status of immunomodulatory pathways to determine their roles in tumor-treating fields–mediated immune activation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results indicated that tumor-treating fields treatment at 0.9 V/cm decreased cell viability and increased cytokine messenger RNA/protein levels, as well as levels of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, relative to controls. The levels of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, and interleukin 6 were markedly increased in tumor-treating fields–treated RAW 264.7 cells cocultured with 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells compared with those in 4T1 or RAW 264.7 cells with or without tumor-treating fields treatment. Moreover, the viability of 4T1 cells treated with the conditioned medium of tumor-treating fields–stimulated RAW 264.7 cells decreased, indicating that macrophage activation by tumor-treating fields effectively killed the tumor cells. Moreover, tumor-treating fields treatment activated the nuclear factor κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways involved in immunomodulatory signaling. CONCLUSION: These results provide critical insights into the mechanisms through which tumor-treating fields affect macrophage-specific immune responses and the efficacy of this method for cancer treatment.",0,"Tumor-Treating Fields Induce RAW264.7 Macrophage Activation Via NK-κB/MAPK Signaling Pathways OBJECTIVE: Tumor-treating fields are currently used to successfully treat various cancers; however, the specific pathways associated with its efficacy remain unknown in the immune responses.

How is Respect and Social Inclusion Conceptualised by Older Adults in an Aspiring Age-Friendly City? A Photovoice Study in the North-West of England,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Age-Friendly Cities (AFC) Guide classifies key characteristics of an AFC according to eight domains. Whilst much age-friendly practice and research have focused on domains of the physical environment, those related to the social environment have received less attention. Using a Photovoice methodology within a Community-Based Participatory Research approach, our study draws on photographs, interviews and focus groups among 26 older Liverpool residents (60+ years) to explore how the city promotes respect and social inclusion (a core WHO AFC domain). Being involved in this photovoice study allowed older adults across four contrasting neighbourhoods to communicate their perspectives directly to Liverpool’s policymakers, service providers and third sector organisations. This paper provides novel insights into how: (i) respect and social inclusion are shaped by aspects of both physical and social environment, and (ii) the accessibility, affordability and sociability of physical spaces and wider social processes (e.g., neighbourhood fragmentation) contributed to or hindered participants’ health, wellbeing, intergenerational relationships and feelings of inclusion and connection.

Alternative medicines for AIDS in resource-poor settings: Insights from exploratory anthropological studies in Asia and Africa,"The emergence of alternative medicines for AIDS in Asia and Africa was discussed at a satellite symposium and the parallel session on alternative and traditional treatments of the AIDSImpact meeting, held in Marseille, in July 2007. These medicines are heterogeneous, both in their presentation and in their geographic and cultural origin. The sessions focused on the role of these medications in selected resource poor settings in Africa and Asia now that access to anti-retroviral therapy is increasing. The aims of the sessions were to (1) identify the actors involved in the diffusion of these alternative medicines for HIV/AIDS, (2) explore uses and forms, and the way these medicines are given legitimacy, (3) reflect on underlying processes of globalisation and cultural differentiation, and (4) define priority questions for future research in this area. This article presents the insights generated at the meeting, illustrated with some findings from the case studies (Uganda, Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, China and Indonesia) that were presented. These case studies reveal the wide range of actors who are involved in the marketing and supply of alternative medicines. Regulatory mechanisms are weak. The efficacy claims of alternative medicines often reinforce a biomedical paradigm for HIV/AIDS, and fit with a healthy living ideology promoted by AIDS care programs and support groups. The AIDSImpact session concluded that more interdisciplinary research is needed on the experience of people living with HIV/AIDS with these alternative medicines, and on the ways in which these products interact (or not) with anti-retroviral therapy at pharmacological as well as psychosocial levels.",0,"Alternative medicines for AIDS in resource-poor settings: Insights from exploratory anthropological studies in Asia and Africa The emergence of alternative medicines for AIDS in Asia and Africa was discussed at a satellite symposium and the parallel session on alternative and traditional treatments of the AIDSImpact meeting, held in Marseille, in July 2007.

Molecular Characterization of the Coproduced Extracellular Vesicles in HEK293 during Virus-Like Particle Production,"[Image: see text] Vaccine therapies based on virus-like particles (VLPs) are currently in the spotlight due to their potential for generating high immunogenic responses while presenting fewer side effects than conventional vaccines. These self-assembled nanostructures resemble the native conformation of the virus but lack genetic material. They are becoming a promising platform for vaccine candidates against several diseases due to the ability of modifying their membrane with antigens from different viruses. The coproduction of extracellular vesicles (EVs) when producing VLPs is a key phenomenon currently still under study. In order to characterize this extracellular environment, a quantitative proteomics approach has been carried out. Three conditions were studied: non-transfected, transfected with an empty plasmid as control, and transfected with a plasmid coding for HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. A shift in EV biogenesis has been detected upon transfection, changing the production from large to small EVs. Another remarkable trait found was the presence of DNA being secreted within vesicles smaller than 200 nm. Studying the protein profile of these biological nanocarriers, it was observed that EVs were reflecting an overall energy homeostasis disruption via mitochondrial protein deregulation. Also, immunomodulatory proteins like ITGB1, ENO3, and PRDX5 were identified and quantified in VLP and EV fractions. These findings provide insight on the nature of the VLP extracellular environment defining the characteristics and protein profile of EVs, with potential to develop new downstream separation strategies or using them as adjuvants in viral therapies.",0,"Molecular Characterization of the Coproduced Extracellular Vesicles in HEK293 during Virus-Like Particle Production [Image: see text] Vaccine therapies based on virus-like particles (VLPs) are currently in the spotlight due to their potential for generating high immunogenic responses while presenting fewer side effects than conventional vaccines.

A Schiff Base-Derived Copper (II) Complex Is a Potent Inducer of Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells by Activating the Intrinsic Pathway,"Metal-based drugs with extensive clinical applications hold great promise for the development of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the last few decades, Schiff bases and their complexes have become well known for their extensive biological potential. In the present study, we examined the antiproliferative effect of a copper (II) complex on HT-29 colon cancer cells. The Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) Schiff base compound demonstrated a potent antiproliferative effect in HT-29 cells, with an IC(50 )value of 2.87 μg/ml after 72 h of treatment. HT-29 cells treated with Cu (II) complexes underwent apoptosis death, as exhibited by a progressive elevation in the proportion of the G(1 ) cell population. At a concentration of 6.25 μg/ml, the Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) compound caused significant elevation in ROS production following perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, as assessed by the measurement of fluorescence intensity in stained cells. Furthermore, the activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 was part of the Cu (II) complex-induced apoptosis, which confirmed the involvement of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, there was no significant activation of caspase-8. Taken together, these results imply that the Cu(BrHAP)(2 ) compound is a potential candidate for further in vivo and clinical colon cancer studies to develop novel chemotherapeutic agents derived from metal-based agents.",0,"A Schiff Base-Derived Copper (II) Complex Is a Potent Inducer of Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells by Activating the Intrinsic Pathway Metal-based drugs with extensive clinical applications hold great promise for the development of cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

Gain-of-Function Research: Ethical Analysis,"Gain-of-function (GOF) research involves experimentation that aims or is expected to (and/or, perhaps, actually does) increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens. Such research, when conducted by responsible scientists, usually aims to improve understanding of disease causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or their potential to cause pandemics. The ultimate objective of such research is to better inform public health and preparedness efforts and/or development of medical countermeasures. Despite these important potential benefits, GOF research (GOFR) can pose risks regarding biosecurity and biosafety. In 2014 the administration of US President Barack Obama called for a “pause” on funding (and relevant research with existing US Government funding) of GOF experiments involving influenza, SARS, and MERS viruses in particular. With announcement of this pause, the US Government launched a “deliberative process” regarding risks and benefits of GOFR to inform future funding decisions—and the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) was tasked with making recommendations to the US Government on this matter. As part of this deliberative process the National Institutes of Health commissioned this Ethical Analysis White Paper, requesting that it provide (1) review and summary of ethical literature on GOFR, (2) identification and analysis of existing ethical and decision-making frameworks relevant to (i) the evaluation of risks and benefits of GOFR, (ii) decision-making about the conduct of GOF studies, and (iii) the development of US policy regarding GOFR (especially with respect to funding of GOFR), and (3) development of an ethical and decision-making framework that may be considered by NSABB when analyzing information provided by GOFR risk-benefit assessment, and when crafting its final recommendations (especially regarding policy decisions about funding of GOFR in particular). The ethical and decision-making framework ultimately developed is based on the idea that there are numerous ethically relevant dimensions upon which any given case of GOFR can fare better or worse (as opposed to there being necessary conditions that are either satisfied or not satisfied, where all must be satisfied in order for a given case of GOFR to be considered ethically acceptable): research imperative, proportionality, minimization of risks, manageability of risks, justice, good governance (i.e., democracy), evidence, and international outlook and engagement. Rather than drawing a sharp bright line between GOFR studies that are ethically acceptable and those that are ethically unacceptable, this framework is designed to indicate where any given study would fall on an ethical spectrum—where imaginable cases of GOFR might range from those that are most ethically acceptable (perhaps even ethically praiseworthy or ethically obligatory), at one end of the spectrum, to those that are most ethically problematic or unacceptable (and thus should not be funded, or conducted), at the other. The aim should be that any GOFR pursued (and/or funded) should be as far as possible towards the former end of the spectrum.",0,"Gain-of-Function Research: Ethical Analysis Gain-of-function (GOF) research involves experimentation that aims or is expected to (and/or, perhaps, actually does) increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens.

Among its potential complications, VA-ECMO may adversely affect lung function through various pathophysiological mechanisms. The interaction of blood components with the biomaterials of the extracorporeal membrane elicits a systemic inflammatory response which may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote the sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within the lung parenchyma. Also, VA-ECMO increases the afterload of the left ventricle (LV) through reverse flow within the thoracic aorta, resulting in increased LV filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, VA-ECMO may result in long-standing pulmonary hypoxia, due to partial shunting of the pulmonary circulation and to reduced pulsatile blood flow within the bronchial circulation. Ultimately, these different abnormalities may result in a state of persisting lung inflammation and fibrotic changes with concomitant functional impairment, which may compromise weaning from VA-ECMO and could possibly result in long-term lung dysfunction. This review presents the mechanisms of lung damage and dysfunction under VA-ECMO and discusses potential strategies to prevent and treat such alterations.",0,"Pulmonary complications associated with veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation: a comprehensive review Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a life-saving technology that provides transient respiratory and circulatory support for patients with profound cardiogenic shock or refractory cardiac arrest.

A genetic analysis identifies a haplotype at adiponectin locus: Association with obesity and type 2 diabetes,"Adiponectin is a prime determinant of the status of insulin resistance. Association studies between adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and metabolic diseases have been reported earlier. However, results are ambiguous due to apparent contradictions. Hence, we investigated (1) the association between ADIPOQ SNPs: −11377C/G, +10211T/G, +45T/G and +276G/T for the risk towards type 2 diabetes (T2D) and, (2) genotype-phenotype association of these SNPs with various biochemical parameters in two cohorts. Genomic DNA of diabetic patients and controls from Gujarat and, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, TaqMan assay and MassArray. Transcript levels of ADIPOQ were assessed in visceral adipose tissue samples, and plasma adiponectin levels were estimated by qPCR and ELISA respectively. Results suggest: (i) reduced HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio in Gujarat patients and its association with +10211T/G and +276G/T, and reduced ADIPOQ transcript levels in T2D, (ii) association of the above SNPs with increased FBG, BMI, TG, TC in Gujarat patients and (iii) increased GGTG haplotype in obese patients of Gujarat population and, (iv) association of −11377C/G with T2D in J&K population.

Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets,"The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results. Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.",0,"Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood.

Exercise and High-Fat Diet in Obesity: Functional Genomics Perspectives of Two Energy Homeostasis Pillars,"The heavy impact of obesity on both the population general health and the economy makes clarifying the underlying mechanisms, identifying pharmacological targets, and developing efficient therapies for obesity of high importance. The main struggle facing obesity research is that the underlying mechanistic pathways are yet to be fully revealed. This limits both our understanding of pathogenesis and therapeutic progress toward treating the obesity epidemic. The current anti-obesity approaches are mainly a controlled diet and exercise which could have limitations. For instance, the “classical” anti-obesity approach of exercise might not be practical for patients suffering from disabilities that prevent them from routine exercise. Therefore, therapeutic alternatives are urgently required. Within this context, pharmacological agents could be relatively efficient in association to an adequate diet that remains the most efficient approach in such situation. Herein, we put a spotlight on potential therapeutic targets for obesity identified following differential genes expression-based studies aiming to find genes that are differentially expressed under diverse conditions depending on physical activity and diet (mainly high-fat), two key factors influencing obesity development and prognosis. Such functional genomics approaches contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that both control obesity development and switch the genetic, biochemical, and metabolic pathways toward a specific energy balance phenotype. It is important to clarify that by “gene-related pathways”, we refer to genes, the corresponding proteins and their potential receptors, the enzymes and molecules within both the cells in the intercellular space, that are related to the activation, the regulation, or the inactivation of the gene or its corresponding protein or pathways. We believe that this emerging area of functional genomics-related exploration will not only lead to novel mechanisms but also new applications and implications along with a new generation of treatments for obesity and the related metabolic disorders especially with the modern advances in pharmacological drug targeting and functional genomics techniques.",0,"Exercise and High-Fat Diet in Obesity: Functional Genomics Perspectives of Two Energy Homeostasis Pillars The heavy impact of obesity on both the population general health and the economy makes clarifying the underlying mechanisms, identifying pharmacological targets, and developing efficient therapies for obesity of high importance.

Dengue in infants: an overview,"Dengue virus (DV) infection causes either a benign syndrome, dengue fever, or a severe syndrome, dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), that is characterized by systemic capillary leakage, thrombocytopaenia and hypovolaemic shock. DHF/DSS occur mainly due to secondary infection by a heterotype DV infection in children and adults but in infants even primary infection by DV causes DHF/DSS. Clinical manifestations of DHF/DSS are more significantly associated with death in infants compared with older children. Vertical transmission of DV and anti-DV IgG has been well reported and is responsible for the pathogenesis of DV disease and its manifestations in infants. The complex pathogenesis of DHF/DSS during primary dengue in infants, with multiple age-related confounding factors, offers unique challenges to investigators. Dengue in infants is not often studied in detail due to practical limitations, but looking at the magnitude of DHF/DSS in infants and the unique opportunities this model provides, there is a need to focus on this problem.

The Cytokine Response to Physical Activity and Training,"Cytokines are soluble glycoproteins that are produced by and mediate communication between and within immune and nonimmune cells, organs and organ systems throughout the body. Pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators constitute the inflammatory cytokines, which are modulated by various stimuli, including physical activity, trauma and infection. Physical activity affects local and systemic cytokine production at different levels, often exhibiting striking similarity to the cytokine response to trauma and infection. The present review examines the cytokine response to short term exercise stress, with an emphasis on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and modulation of both innate and specific immune parameters through cytokine regulation. The effects of long term exercise on cytokine responses and the possible impact on various facets of the immune system are also discussed, with reference to both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of exercise training. Finally, the validity of using exercise as a model for trauma and sepsis is scrutinised in the light of physiological changes, symptomatology and outcome, and limitations of the model are addressed. Further studies, examining the effect of exercise, trauma and infection on novel cytokines and cytokine systems are needed to elucidate the significance of cytokine regulation by physical activity and, more importantly, to clarify the health implications of short and long term physical activity with respect to overall immune function and resistance to infection.",0,"The Cytokine Response to Physical Activity and Training Cytokines are soluble glycoproteins that are produced by and mediate communication between and within immune and nonimmune cells, organs and organ systems throughout the body.

Comparing the estimates of effect obtained from statistical causal inference methods: An example using bovine respiratory disease in feedlot cattle,"The causal effect of an exposure on an outcome of interest in an observational study cannot be estimated directly if the confounding variables are not controlled. Many approaches are available for estimating the causal effect of an exposure. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the advantages associated with using inverse probability weighting (IPW) and doubly robust estimation of the odds ratio in terms of reduced bias. IPW approach can be used to adjust for confounding variables and provide unbiased estimates of the exposure’s causal effect. For cluster-structured data, as is common in animal populations, inverse conditional probability weighting (ICPW) approach can provide a robust estimation of the causal effect. Doubly robust estimation can provide a robust method even when the specification of the model form is uncertain. In this paper, the usage of IPW, ICPW, and doubly robust approaches are illustrated with a subset of data with complete covariates from the Australian-based National Bovine Respiratory Disease Initiative as well as simulated data. We evaluate the causal effect of prior bovine viral diarrhea exposure on bovine respiratory disease in feedlot cattle. The results show that the IPW, ICPW and doubly robust approaches would provide a more accurate estimation of the exposure effect than the traditional outcome regression model, and doubly robust approaches are the most preferable overall.",0,"Comparing the estimates of effect obtained from statistical causal inference methods: An example using bovine respiratory disease in feedlot cattle The causal effect of an exposure on an outcome of interest in an observational study cannot be estimated directly if the confounding variables are not controlled.

The Potential Benefit of Monitoring Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs),"The significant increase in worldwide morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) indicates that the efficacy of existing strategies addressing this crisis may need improvement. Early identification of the metabolic irregularities associated with the disease process may be a key to developing early intervention strategies. Unhealthy lifestyle behaviours are well established drivers of the development of several NCDs, but the impact of such behaviours on health can vary considerably between individuals. How can it be determined if an individual’s unique set of lifestyle behaviours is producing disease? Accumulating evidence suggests that lifestyle-associated activation of oxidative and inflammatory processes is primary driver of the cell and tissue damage which underpins the development of NCDs. However, the benefit of monitoring subclinical inflammation and oxidative activity has not yet been established. After reviewing relevant studies in this context, we suggest that quantification of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers during the disease-free prodromal stage of NCD development may have clinical relevance as a timely indicator of the presence of subclinical metabolic changes, in the individual, portending the development of disease. Monitoring markers of oxidative and inflammatory activity may therefore enable earlier and more efficient strategies to both prevent NCD development and/or monitor the effectiveness of treatment.",0,"The Potential Benefit of Monitoring Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) The significant increase in worldwide morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) indicates that the efficacy of existing strategies addressing this crisis may need improvement.

Silencing of lncRNA MIAT alleviates LPS-induced pneumonia via regulating miR-147a/NKAP/NF-κB axis,"Purpose: Pneumonia is a respiratory disease with an increasing incidence in recent years. More and more studies have revealed that lncRNAs can regulate the transcriptional expression of target genes at different stage. Herein, we aimed to explore the effect of lncRNA MIAT in LPS-induced pneumonia, and further illuminate the possible underlying mechanisms. Method and results: Mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS, and the lung inflammation was evaluated. Microarray showed lncRNA MIAT was up-regulated in LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. And qRT-PCR and FISH assay indicated that MIAT was increased in mice with LPS injection. Functional analysis showed sh-MIAT inhibited LPS-induced inflammation response, inhibited apoptosis level and protected lung function. As well, si-MIAT removed the injury of LPS on mouse lung epithelial TC-1 cells, and inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, MIAT acted as a sponge of miR-147a, and miR-147a directly targeted NKAP. Functionally, AMO-147a or NKAP remitted the beneficial effects of si-MIAT on LPS-induced inflammation response of TC-1 cells. Conclusion: Deletion of MIAT protected against LPS-induced lung inflammation via regulating miR-147a/NKAP, which might provide new insight for pneumonia treatment.",0,"Silencing of lncRNA MIAT alleviates LPS-induced pneumonia via regulating miR-147a/NKAP/NF-κB axis Purpose: Pneumonia is a respiratory disease with an increasing incidence in recent years.

Nutraceutical Curcumin with Promising Protection against Herpesvirus Infections and Their Associated Inflammation: Mechanisms and Pathways,"Herpesviruses are DNA viruses that infect humans and animals with the ability to induce latent and lytic infections in their hosts, causing critical health complications. The enrolment of nutraceutical anti-herpesvirus drugs in clinical investigations with promising levels of reduced resistance, free or minimal cellular toxicity, and diverse mechanisms of action might be an effective way to defeat challenges that hurdle the progress of anti-herpesvirus drug development, including the problems with drug resistance and recurrent infections. Therefore, in this review, we aim to hunt down all investigations that feature the curative properties of curcumin, a principal bioactive phenolic compound of the spice turmeric, in regard to various human and animal herpesvirus infections and inflammation connected with these diseases. Curcumin was explored with potent antiherpetic actions against herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, human cytomegalovirus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, Epstein–Barr virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, and pseudorabies virus. The mechanisms and pathways by which curcumin inhibits anti-herpesvirus activities by targeting multiple steps in herpesvirus life/infectious cycle are emphasized. Improved strategies to overcome bioavailability challenges that limit its use in clinical practice, along with approaches and new directions to enhance the anti-herpesvirus efficacy of this compound, are also reviewed. According to the reviewed studies, this paper presents curcumin as a promising natural drug for the prevention and treatment of herpesvirus infections and their associated inflammatory diseases.",0,"Nutraceutical Curcumin with Promising Protection against Herpesvirus Infections and Their Associated Inflammation: Mechanisms and Pathways Herpesviruses are DNA viruses that infect humans and animals with the ability to induce latent and lytic infections in their hosts, causing critical health complications.

Curcumin was explored with potent antiherpetic actions against herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, human cytomegalovirus, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, Epstein–Barr virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, and pseudorabies virus. The mechanisms and pathways by which curcumin inhibits anti-herpesvirus activities by targeting multiple steps in herpesvirus life/infectious cycle are emphasized. Improved strategies to overcome bioavailability challenges that limit its use in clinical practice, along with approaches and new directions to enhance the anti-herpesvirus efficacy of this compound, are also reviewed. According to the reviewed studies, this paper presents curcumin as a promising natural drug for the prevention and treatment of herpesvirus infections and their associated inflammatory diseases.",nutraceut curcumin promis protect herpesviru infect associ inflamm mechan pathway herpesvirus dna virus infect human anim abil induc latent lytic infect host caus critic health complic enrol nutraceut drug clinic investig promis level reduc resist free minim cellular toxic divers mechan action might effect way defeat challeng hurdl progress drug develop includ problem drug resist recurr infect therefor review aim hunt investig featur cur properti curcumin princip bioactiv phenol compound spice turmer regard variou human anim herpesviru infect inflamm connect diseas curcumin explor potent antiherpet action herp simplex viru type 1 type 2 human cytomegaloviru kaposi herpesviru viru bovin herpesviru 1 pseudorabi viru mechan pathway curcumin inhibit activ target multipl step herpesviru cycl emphas improv strategi overcom bioavail challeng limit use clinic practic along approach new direct enhanc efficaci compound also review accord review studi paper present curcumin promis natur drug prevent treatment herpesviru infect associ inflammatori diseas,1
Revisiting early-stage COVID-19 strategy options,"Background: Early-stage interventions in a potential pandemic are important to understand as they can make the difference between runaway exponential growth that is hard to turn back and stopping the spread before it gets that far. COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal; while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods: I examine two factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread and the risks of basing strategy on untested claims, such as potential protective value of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine. Results: Differences in disease progression as well as the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase or damping it down later can be elucidated by a study of asymptomatic infection. An early study to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but how contagious they are would have informed policy on nonpharmaceutical interventions but could still be of value to understand containment during vaccine roll out. Conclusions: When a COVID-19 outbreak is at a level that makes accurate trace-and test possible, investigation of asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to enhance understanding of spread and variability in the disease as well as policy options for slowing the spread. Understanding mild cases could shed light on the disease in the longer term, including whether vaccines prevent contagiousness.",0,"Revisiting early-stage COVID-19 strategy options Background: Early-stage interventions in a potential pandemic are important to understand as they can make the difference between runaway exponential growth that is hard to turn back and stopping the spread before it gets that far.

Psychological Predictors of Health Anxiety in Response to the Zika Virus,"The threat of a United States (U.S.) Zika virus pandemic during 2015–2016 was associated with public anxiety. Such threats represent opportunities to examine hypotheses about health anxiety. The present study investigated psychological predictors of Zika-related anxiety during the 2015–2016 outbreak. U.S. adults (N = 216) completed a battery of measures assessing Zika-related anxiety as well as psychological variables hypothesized to predict anxious responding to the threat of a domestic Zika outbreak. Contrary to hypotheses, regression analyses indicated that only contamination severity overestimates and greater Zika knowledge significantly predicted Zika-related anxiety.

The Multifaceted Poliovirus 2A Protease: Regulation of Gene Expression by Picornavirus Proteases,"After entry into animal cells, most viruses hijack essential components involved in gene expression. This is the case of poliovirus, which abrogates cellular translation soon after virus internalization. Abrogation is achieved by cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII by the viral protease 2A. Apart from the interference of poliovirus with cellular protein synthesis, other gene expression steps such as RNA and protein trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm are also altered. Poliovirus 2A(pro) is capable of hydrolyzing components of the nuclear pore, thus preventing an efficient antiviral response by the host cell. Here, we compare in detail poliovirus 2A(pro) with other viral proteins (from picornaviruses and unrelated families) as regard to their activity on key host factors that control gene expression. It is possible that future analyses to determine the cellular proteins targeted by 2A(pro) will uncover other cellular functions ablated by poliovirus infection. Further understanding of the cellular proteins hydrolyzed by 2A(pro) will add further insight into the molecular mechanism by which poliovirus and other viruses interact with the host cell.",0,"The Multifaceted Poliovirus 2A Protease: Regulation of Gene Expression by Picornavirus Proteases After entry into animal cells, most viruses hijack essential components involved in gene expression.

Clinical pathways and patient-related outcomes in hospital-based settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Clinical pathways represent a multi-disciplinary approach to translate clinical practice guidelines into practical interventions. The literature from 2010 onward regarding the efficacy of adopting a clinical pathway on patient-related outcomes within the in-hospital setting has not been synthesized yet. For this reason, this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to critically synthesize the literature from 2010 onward about the efficacy of clinical pathways, compared with standard of care, on patient-related outcomes in different populations and to determine the effects of clinical pathways on patient outcomes. We searched PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and reference lists of the included studies. Two independent reviewers screened the 360 identified articles and selected fifteen eligible articles, which were evaluated for content and risk of bias. Eleven studies were finally included. Given the commonalities of the measured outcomes, a meta-analysis including eight studies was performed to evaluate the effect size of the associations between clinical pathways and quality of life (OR=1.472 [0.483–4.486]; p=0.496), and two meta-analyses, including four studies, were performed to evaluate the effect sizes of the associations between clinical pathways with satisfaction (OR=2.226 [0.868–5.708]; p=0.096) and length of stay (OR=0,585 [0.349–0.982]; p=0.042).

Bioinformatics tools developed to support BioCompute Objects,"Developments in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) result in an exponential increase in the amount of data generated by sequencing experiments, an increase in the complexity of bioinformatics analysis reporting and an increase in the types of data generated. These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. BioCompute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloud-based platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details. We also demonstrate that the BCO tools described in the paper provide an approach to solve the long-standing challenge of standardizing workflow descriptions that are both human and machine readable while accommodating manual and automated curation with evidence tagging.

Effects on Steroid 5-Alpha Reductase Gene Expression of Thai Rice Bran Extracts and Molecular Dynamics Study on SRD5A2,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen hormone, is an important aetiologic factor of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or hair loss. Steroid 5-alpha reductases (SRD5As) increase DHT production in the scalp hair follicles, resulting in hair thinning and hair loss. Even though synthetic SRD5A inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) are effective in treating AGA, they cause adverse effects. This has led to an increased interest in alternative treatments from natural sources. The value of Thai rice bran has increased because several of its components may have use in AGA treatment. This study aimed to compare the suppression of the expression of SRD5A genes (type 1–3) exerted by several Thai rice bran extracts and investigate the interactional mechanism of their components towards SRD5A type 2. Tubtim Chumphae rice bran (TRB) had the highest sum of overall bioactive compounds. Among all extracts, the expression of SRD5A genes was suppressed by TRB as well as finasteride. In silico simulation showed that α-tocopherol had the greatest interaction with SRD5A type 2. Our findings identified α-tocopherol as the key bioactive in TRB; it could be developed as an anti-hair loss product. ABSTRACT: Steroid 5-alpha reductases (SRD5As) are responsible for the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a potent androgen, which is the aetiologic factor of androgenetic alopecia. This study aimed to compare the SRD5A gene expression suppression activity exerted by Thai rice bran extracts and their components and investigate the interactional mechanism between bioactive compounds and SRD5A2 using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Bran of Oryza sativa cv. Tubtim Chumphae (TRB), Yamuechaebia Morchor (YRB), Riceberry (RRB), and Malinil Surin (MRB), all rice milling by-products, was solvent-extracted. The ethanolic extract of TRB had the highest sum of overall bioactive compounds (γ-oryzanol; α-, β-, and γ-tocopherol; phenolics; and flavonoids). Among all extracts, TRB greatly downregulated the expression of SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3; there were no significant differences between TRB and finasteride regarding SRD5A suppression. The linear relationship and principal component analysis supported that the α-tocopherol content was correlated with the SRD5A suppression exerted by TRB. Furthermore, MD simulation demonstrated that α-tocopherol had the highest binding affinity towards SRD5A2 by interacting with residues Phe118 and Trp201. Our findings indicate that α-tocopherol effectively downregulates the expression of SRD5A genes and inhibits SRD5A2 activity, actions that are comparable to standard finasteride.

Microcalorimetric studies of the effects on the interactions of human recombinant interferon-α2a,"The applicability of the physical stability of protein solution monitored by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was evaluated. The second virial coefficient, b(2), derived from the dilution enthalpies of protein solution measured by ITC under various experimental conditions was studied. The protein applied in this work is human recombinant interferon-α2a (hrIFN-α2a), which is a commercial drug applied for the treatment of virus-infected diseases. The results obtained were used to predict the possibility of hrIFN-α2a aggregation, and the prediction can be further confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Various factors affecting the stability of protein solution were investigated, for example, temperature, salts, surfactants, and mechanical stress. Specifically, the results show that the dilution enthalpy of hrIFN-α2a increased with increasing temperature and NaCl concentration, while b(2) decreased, indicating that the attraction between hrIFN-α2a molecules was enhanced under these conditions. On studying the effect of mechanical stress, the data obtained reveals that the introduction of centrifugal or vortex force strengthened the attractive forces between hrIFN-α2a molecules. These implications were supported by SEC data, demonstrating that the amount of aggregated hrIFN-α2a was increased. As a consequence, the methodologies presented in this investigation offer a possibility of monitoring the physical stability of protein solution at various stages of recovery, purification as well as the development of appropriate drug storage formulations.",0,"Microcalorimetric studies of the effects on the interactions of human recombinant interferon-α2a The applicability of the physical stability of protein solution monitored by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was evaluated.

Non-Invasive Delivery of Nano-Emulsified Sesame Oil-Extract of Turmeric Attenuates Lung Inflammation,"Turmeric, the golden Indian spice, and the edible oil of sesame seeds are the essential ingredients of Indian food created by ancestors and established the belief of the curative effect of food for many generations. Considering the anti-inflammatory effects of turmeric, we formulated a nano-emulsion of turmeric infused in edible sesame oil, with a globule size of 200–250 nm using high-energy microfluidization. The product with a zeta potential of −11.5 mV showed spherical globules when imaged for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We explored the anti-inflammatory potential of this edible nano-emulsion in lung inflammation. The lungs are the internal organ most vulnerable to infection, injury, and rapid inflammation from the external environment because of their constant exposure to pollutants, pathogenic microorganisms, and viruses. We evaluated the nano-emulsion for efficacy in ovalbumin-induced lung injury in mice with an oral treatment for two weeks. The therapeutic effect of nano-emulsion of the sesame oil-extract of turmeric was evident from biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung histopathology, and flow cytometric analysis. The developed nano-emulsion significantly reduced the inflammation and damage to the alveolar network in ovalbumin-injured mice. Significant reduction in the levels of neutrophils and inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was observed in the nano-emulsion-treated group. Leukotriene B4 and IgE were also significantly altered in the treated group, thus suggesting the suitability of the formulation for the treatment of allergy and other inflammatory conditions. The nano-emulsification process potentiated the immunoregulatory effect of turmeric, as observed from the elevated levels of the natural anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. The dietary constituents-based nano-emulsion of spice turmeric helped in scavenging the free radicals in the injured lungs, thus modulating the inflammation pathway. This easily scalable formulation technology approach can therefore serve as a potential noninvasive and safe treatment modality for reducing lung inflammation in lung injury cases.",0,"Non-Invasive Delivery of Nano-Emulsified Sesame Oil-Extract of Turmeric Attenuates Lung Inflammation Turmeric, the golden Indian spice, and the edible oil of sesame seeds are the essential ingredients of Indian food created by ancestors and established the belief of the curative effect of food for many generations.

Nanoscale Structure Determination of Murray Valley Encephalitis and Powassan Virus Non-Coding RNAs,"Viral infections are responsible for numerous deaths worldwide. Flaviviruses, which contain RNA as their genetic material, are one of the most pathogenic families of viruses. There is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting that their 5’ and 3’ non-coding terminal regions are critical for their survival. Information on their structural features is essential to gain detailed insights into their functions and interactions with host proteins. In this study, the 5’ and 3’ terminal regions of Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Powassan virus were examined using biophysical and computational modeling methods. First, we used size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifuge methods to investigate the purity of in-vitro transcribed RNAs. Next, we employed small-angle X-ray scattering techniques to study solution conformation and low-resolution structures of these RNAs, which suggest that the 3’ terminal regions are highly extended as compared to the 5’ terminal regions for both viruses. Using computational modeling tools, we reconstructed 3-dimensional structures of each RNA fragment and compared them with derived small-angle X-ray scattering low-resolution structures. This approach allowed us to reinforce that the 5’ terminal regions adopt more dynamic structures compared to the mainly double-stranded structures of the 3’ terminal regions.",0,"Nanoscale Structure Determination of Murray Valley Encephalitis and Powassan Virus Non-Coding RNAs Viral infections are responsible for numerous deaths worldwide.

Environmental DNA monitoring of oncogenic viral shedding and genomic profiling of sea turtle fibropapillomatosis reveals unusual viral dynamics,"Pathogen-induced cancers account for 15% of human tumors and are a growing concern for endangered wildlife. Fibropapillomatosis is an expanding virally and environmentally co-induced sea turtle tumor epizootic. Chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) is implicated as a causative virus, but its transmission method and specific role in oncogenesis and progression is unclear. We applied environmental (e)DNA-based viral monitoring to assess viral shedding as a direct means of transmission, and the relationship between tumor burden, surgical resection and ChHV5 shedding. To elucidate the abundance and transcriptional status of ChHV5 across early, established, regrowth and internal tumors we conducted genomics and transcriptomics. We determined that ChHV5 is shed into the water column, representing a likely transmission route, and revealed novel temporal shedding dynamics and tumor burden correlations. ChHV5 was more abundant in the water column than in marine leeches. We also revealed that ChHV5 is latent in fibropapillomatosis, including early stage, regrowth and internal tumors; higher viral transcription is not indicative of poor patient outcome, and high ChHV5 loads predominantly arise from latent virus. These results expand our knowledge of the cellular and shedding dynamics of ChHV5 and can provide insights into temporal transmission dynamics and viral oncogenesis not readily investigable in tumors of terrestrial species.",0,"Environmental DNA monitoring of oncogenic viral shedding and genomic profiling of sea turtle fibropapillomatosis reveals unusual viral dynamics Pathogen-induced cancers account for 15% of human tumors and are a growing concern for endangered wildlife.

"Investigations of Shape, Material and Excitation Wavelength Effects on Field Enhancement in SERS Advanced Tips","This article, a part of the larger research project of Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), describes an advanced study focusing on the shapes and materials of Tip-Enhanced Raman Scattering (TERS) designated to serve as part of a novel imager device. The initial aim was to define the optimal shape of the “probe”: tip or cavity, round or sharp. The investigations focused on the effect of shape (hemi-sphere, hemispheroid, ellipsoidal cavity, ellipsoidal rod, nano-cone), and the effect of material (Ag, Au, Al) on enhancement, as well as the effect of excitation wavelengths on the electric field. Complementary results were collected: numerical simulations consolidated with analytical models, based on solid assumptions. Preliminary experimental results of fabrication and structural characterization are also presented. Thorough analyses were performed around critical parameters, such as the plasmonic metal—Silver, Aluminium or Gold—using Rakic model, the tip geometry—sphere, spheroid, ellipsoid, nano-cone, nano-shell, rod, cavity—and the geometry of the plasmonic array: cross-talk in multiple nanostructures.

Interaction of rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in conventionally-reared dairy calves,"A study was made of the effects of rotavirus and/or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on dairy calves born and suckled on the farm and subsequently reared in isolation. Calves were orally inoculated at 6 days old with either rotavirus (5), ETEC (7), rotavirus and ETEC (5) or remained uninoculated controls (4), and their reactions were recorded by clinical, microbiological, and pathological observations. Rotavirus infection consistently produced diarrhoea, while ETEC inoculated alone did not colonise the intestine. In dual infections, both rotavirus and ETEC multiplied, although the severity of diarrhoea was not greater than that caused by rotavirus alone. Some ETEC-inoculated calves developed subsequent naturally-acquired rotavirus infections, but in these no ETEC multiplication occurred. The results suggest that prior or simultaneous rotavirus infection is necessary to enable ETEC colonisation of the intestine in convenstional calves of this age.",0,"Interaction of rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in conventionally-reared dairy calves A study was made of the effects of rotavirus and/or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) on dairy calves born and suckled on the farm and subsequently reared in isolation.

Deciphering Biosignatures in Planetary Contexts,"Microbial life permeates Earth's critical zone and has likely inhabited nearly all our planet's surface and near subsurface since before the beginning of the sedimentary rock record. Given the vast time that Earth has been teeming with life, do astrobiologists truly understand what geological features untouched by biological processes would look like? In the search for extraterrestrial life in the Universe, it is critical to determine what constitutes a biosignature across multiple scales, and how this compares with “abiosignatures” formed by nonliving processes. Developing standards for abiotic and biotic characteristics would provide quantitative metrics for comparison across different data types and observational time frames. The evidence for life detection falls into three categories of biosignatures: (1) substances, such as elemental abundances, isotopes, molecules, allotropes, enantiomers, minerals, and their associated properties; (2) objects that are physical features such as mats, fossils including trace-fossils and microbialites (stromatolites), and concretions; and (3) patterns, such as physical three-dimensional or conceptual n-dimensional relationships of physical or chemical phenomena, including patterns of intermolecular abundances of organic homologues, and patterns of stable isotopic abundances between and within compounds. Five key challenges that warrant future exploration by the astrobiology community include the following: (1) examining phenomena at the “right” spatial scales because biosignatures may elude us if not examined with the appropriate instrumentation or modeling approach at that specific scale; (2) identifying the precise context across multiple spatial and temporal scales to understand how tangible biosignatures may or may not be preserved; (3) increasing capability to mine big data sets to reveal relationships, for example, how Earth's mineral diversity may have evolved in conjunction with life; (4) leveraging cyberinfrastructure for data management of biosignature types, characteristics, and classifications; and (5) using three-dimensional to n-D representations of biotic and abiotic models overlain on multiple overlapping spatial and temporal relationships to provide new insights.",0,"Deciphering Biosignatures in Planetary Contexts Microbial life permeates Earth's critical zone and has likely inhabited nearly all our planet's surface and near subsurface since before the beginning of the sedimentary rock record.

Psychometric properties of the stress control mindset measure in university students from Australia and the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Beliefs about the consequences of stress, stress mindsets, are associated with health and performance outcomes under stress. This article reports the development and examination of the psychometric properties of a measure of stress mindset: The Stress Control Mindset Measure (SCMM). The measure is consistent with theory on mindsets about self‐attributes and conceptualizes stress mindset as the extent to which individuals endorse beliefs that stress can be enhancing. METHODS: The study adopted a correlational cross‐sectional survey design in two student samples. Undergraduate students from an Australian university (Sample 1, N = 218) and a UK university (Sample 2, N = 214) completed the SCMM and measures of health and well‐being outcomes. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a four‐factor structure and strict measurement invariance across samples (ΔCFI < 0.01). Reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and concurrent validity of the overall SCMM were supported in both samples. Incremental validity was supported for most outcomes, accounting for significantly more variance (between 2.2% and 5.9%) in health and well‐being outcomes than an existing measure. CONCLUSIONS: Current data provide preliminary support for the SCMM as a reliable and valid measure with good psychometric properties and theoretically consistent relations with health outcomes under stress. Findings provide initial evidence supporting the potential utility of the SCMM in future research examining relations between stress mindsets and health and performance outcomes.",0,"Psychometric properties of the stress control mindset measure in university students from Australia and the UK INTRODUCTION: Beliefs about the consequences of stress, stress mindsets, are associated with health and performance outcomes under stress.

Opposite associations of collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction with intergroup aggression via belief in the hedonistic function of revenge,"We investigated whether collective narcissism (i.e., believing that the in-group is exceptional but insufficiently recognized by others) and in-group satisfaction (i.e., believing that the in-group is a source of satisfaction) have opposite, unique associations with intergroup aggression via belief in the hedonistic function of revenge (i.e., an expectation of emotional reward from harming others in response to feeling oneself harmed). Results of two studies conducted in Poland (N = 675) found that collective narcissism is positively related to belief in the hedonistic function of revenge, whereas in-group satisfaction is negatively related, and both are related to intergroup aggression. These relationships were found only when the overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction was partialled out. The results shed a new light on the mechanisms linking in-group positivity to out-group derogation, and highlight the importance of investigating revenge motivations in the intergroup relations.",0,"Opposite associations of collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction with intergroup aggression via belief in the hedonistic function of revenge We investigated whether collective narcissism (i.e., believing that the in-group is exceptional but insufficiently recognized by others) and in-group satisfaction (i.e., believing that the in-group is a source of satisfaction) have opposite, unique associations with intergroup aggression via belief in the hedonistic function of revenge (i.e., an expectation of emotional reward from harming others in response to feeling oneself harmed).

Intelligent Prediction and Optimization Algorithm for Chronic Disease Rehabilitation in Sports Using Big Data,"This paper investigates chronic diseases in the older population in the Chinese province of Henan and analyzes the rehabilitation needs and the current supply of related services in different levels of medical and elderly care institutions. We explore the fundamental causes for the diversified needs and insufficient supply of chronic disease patients in professional medical services and daily care. Using big data and deep learning (DL) in the sports domain, we propose a novel and intelligent prediction system for chronic diseases. Our model explores effective sinking methods of high-quality medical resources, training and guidance practices, assistance and guidance measures, and the ability to improve the grassroots services so that more chronically ill populations can stay in the community family as long as possible. In such an environment, they can receive cheap, safe, and suitable services. It can also lead to further improvement in constructing the government's regional medical rehabilitation care service system and can formulate long-term care relevant compensation policies.",0,"Intelligent Prediction and Optimization Algorithm for Chronic Disease Rehabilitation in Sports Using Big Data This paper investigates chronic diseases in the older population in the Chinese province of Henan and analyzes the rehabilitation needs and the current supply of related services in different levels of medical and elderly care institutions.

Droplet-Transmitted Infection Risk Ranking Based on Close Proximity Interaction,"We propose an automatic method to identify people who are potentially-infected by droplet-transmitted diseases. This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.",0,"Droplet-Transmitted Infection Risk Ranking Based on Close Proximity Interaction We propose an automatic method to identify people who are potentially-infected by droplet-transmitted diseases.

Pulmonary Infections: Imaging with CT,"Computed tomography (CT) plays a key role in various kinds of pulmonary infections especially in immunocompromised patients, owing to its much higher sensitivity and specificity than the traditionally performed chest X-ray. CT permits the detection of the main infectious pattern and associated findings with high confidence and allows for the precise assessment of all involved structures, to potentially guide a bronchoalveolar lavage or another diagnostic procedure, and to ensure a reliable follow-up. It may be performed at a carefully chosen dose, which may nearly reach that of a chest X-ray in specific situations. The importance of post-processing tools is undeniable in some conditions, in particular for the evaluation of micronodules in the immunocompromised population. The wide spectrum of features of specific organisms according to the immune status, such as in aspergillosis or tuberculosis, must be known, as well as the potential of atypical presentations in case of Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) pneumonia when occurring in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. In all cases, underlying disorders must be considered as well as all the differential diagnoses. Overall, CT definitely helps clinicians to diagnose pulmonary infections and to make treatment decisions, especially in vulnerable patients.",0,"Pulmonary Infections: Imaging with CT Computed tomography (CT) plays a key role in various kinds of pulmonary infections especially in immunocompromised patients, owing to its much higher sensitivity and specificity than the traditionally performed chest X-ray.

Role of Antioxidants and Natural Products in Inflammation,"Inflammation is a comprehensive array of physiological response to a foreign organism, including human pathogens, dust particles, and viruses. Inflammations are mainly divided into acute and chronic inflammation depending on various inflammatory processes and cellular mechanisms. Recent investigations have clarified that inflammation is a major factor for the progression of various chronic diseases/disorders, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, eye disorders, arthritis, obesity, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. Free radical productions from different biological and environmental sources are due to an imbalance of natural antioxidants which further leads to various inflammatory associated diseases. In this review article, we have outlined the inflammatory process and its cellular mechanisms involved in the progression of various chronic modern human diseases. In addition, we have discussed the role of free radicals-induced tissue damage, antioxidant defence, and molecular mechanisms in chronic inflammatory diseases/disorders. The systematic knowledge regarding the role of inflammation and its associated adverse effects can provide a clear understanding in the development of innovative therapeutic targets from natural sources that are intended for suppression of various chronic inflammations associated diseases.",0,"Role of Antioxidants and Natural Products in Inflammation Inflammation is a comprehensive array of physiological response to a foreign organism, including human pathogens, dust particles, and viruses.

Validity and precision of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for climacteric women using computational intelligence techniques,"This study aimed to evaluate the validity and precision of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for climacteric women using computational intelligence techniques. The instrument was applied to 873 women aged between 40 and 65 years. Considering the proposal to regroup the set of data related to the level of physical activity of climacteric women using the IPAQ, we used 2 algorithms: Kohonen and k-means, and, to evaluate the validity of these clusters, 3 indexes were used: Silhouette, PBM and Dunn. The questionnaire was tested for validity (factor analysis) and precision (Cronbach's alpha). The Random Forests technique was used to assess the importance of the variables that make up the IPAQ. To classify these variables, we used 3 algorithms: Suport Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree. The results of the tests to evaluate the clusters suggested that what is recommended for IPAQ, when applied to climacteric women, is to categorize the results into two groups. The factor analysis resulted in three factors, with factor 1 being composed of variables 3 to 6; factor 2 for variables 7 and 8; and factor 3 for variables 1 and 2. Regarding the reliability estimate, the results of the standardized Cronbach's alpha test showed values between 0.63 to 0.85, being considered acceptable for the construction of the construct. In the test of importance of the variables that make up the instrument, the results showed that variables 1 and 8 presented a lesser degree of importance and by the analysis of Accuracy, Recall, Precision and area under the ROC curve, there was no variation when the results were analyzed with all IPAQ variables but variables 1 and 8. Through this analysis, we concluded that the IPAQ, short version, has adequate measurement properties for the investigated population.",0,"Validity and precision of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for climacteric women using computational intelligence techniques This study aimed to evaluate the validity and precision of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for climacteric women using computational intelligence techniques.

Do Privacy Concerns About Social Robots Affect Use Intentions? Evidence From an Experimental Vignette Study,"While the privacy implications of social robots have been increasingly discussed and privacy-sensitive robotics is becoming a research field within human–robot interaction, little empirical research has investigated privacy concerns about robots and the effect they have on behavioral intentions. To address this gap, we present the results of an experimental vignette study that includes antecedents from the privacy, robotics, technology adoption, and trust literature. Using linear regression analysis, with the privacy-invasiveness of a fictional but realistic robot as the key manipulation, we show that privacy concerns affect use intention significantly and negatively. Compared with earlier work done through a survey, where we found a robot privacy paradox, the experimental vignette approach allows for a more realistic and tangible assessment of respondents' concerns and behavioral intentions, showing how potential robot users take into account privacy as consideration for future behavior. We contextualize our findings within broader debates on privacy and data protection with smart technologies.",0,"Do Privacy Concerns About Social Robots Affect Use Intentions?

Characterizing and controlling the inflammatory network during influenza A virus infection,"To gain insights into the pathogenesis of influenza A virus (IAV) infections, this study focused on characterizing the inflammatory network and identifying key proteins by combining high-throughput data and computational techniques. We constructed the cell-specific normal and inflammatory networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections through integrating high-throughput data. We demonstrated that better discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks by network entropy than by other topological metrics. Moreover, we identified different dynamical interactions among TLR2, IL-1β, IL10 and NFκB between normal and inflammatory networks using optimization algorithm. In particular, good robustness and multistability of inflammatory sub-networks were discovered. Furthermore, we identified a complex, TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5, which may play important roles in controlling inflammation, and demonstrated that changes in network entropy of this complex negatively correlated to those of three proteins: TNFα, NFκB and COX-2. These findings provide significant hypotheses for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of infectious diseases and developing control strategies.",0,"Characterizing and controlling the inflammatory network during influenza A virus infection To gain insights into the pathogenesis of influenza A virus (IAV) infections, this study focused on characterizing the inflammatory network and identifying key proteins by combining high-throughput data and computational techniques.

GenomeLandscaper: Landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps assessing chromosome architecture,"Assessing correctness of an assembled chromosome architecture is a central challenge. We create a geometric analysis method (called GenomeLandscaper) to conduct landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps (GFM), trace large-scale repetitive regions, and assess their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes. We develop an alignment-free method for phylogenetics analysis. The human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY) are analysed as a proof-of-concept study. We construct a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM) for them, and a landscape compatibility among relatives is observed. But a long sharp straight line on the GGFM breaks such a landscape compatibility, distinguishing GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p7.chrY) from GRCh37p13.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY. We delete a 1.30-Mbp target segment to rescue the landscape compatibility, matching the antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY. We re-locate it into the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY, matching a gap placeholder of GRCh37p13.chrY. We decompose it into sub-constituents (such as BACs, interspersed repeats, and tandem repeats) and trace their homologues by phylogenetics analysis. We elucidate that most examined tandem repeats are of reasonable quality, but the BAC-sized repeats, 173U1020C (176.46 Kbp) and 5U41068C (205.34 Kbp), are likely over-repeated. These results offer unique insights into the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of the human Y chromosomes.",0,"GenomeLandscaper: Landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps assessing chromosome architecture Assessing correctness of an assembled chromosome architecture is a central challenge.

A host type I interferon response is induced by cytosolic sensing of the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP,"The innate immune system responds to unique molecular signatures that are widely conserved among microbes but that are not normally present in host cells. Compounds that stimulate innate immune pathways may be valuable in the design of novel adjuvants, vaccines, and other immunotherapeutics. The cyclic dinucleotide cyclic-di–guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a recently appreciated second messenger that plays critical regulatory roles in many species of bacteria but is not produced by eukaryotic cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have previously suggested that c-di-GMP is a potent immunostimulatory compound recognized by mouse and human cells. We provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol of mammalian cells via a novel immunosurveillance pathway. The potency of cytosolic signaling induced by c-di-GMP is comparable to that induced by cytosolic delivery of DNA, and both nucleic acids induce a similar transcriptional profile, including triggering of type I interferons and coregulated genes via induction of TBK1, IRF3, nuclear factor κB, and MAP kinases. However, the cytosolic pathway that senses c-di-GMP appears to be distinct from all known nucleic acid–sensing pathways. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which host cells can induce an inflammatory response to a widely produced bacterial ligand.",0,"A host type I interferon response is induced by cytosolic sensing of the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP The innate immune system responds to unique molecular signatures that are widely conserved among microbes but that are not normally present in host cells.

Late immune consequences of combat trauma: a review of trauma-related immune dysfunction and potential therapies,"With improvements in personnel and vehicular body armor, robust casualty evacuation capabilities, and damage control resuscitation strategies, more combat casualties are surviving to reach higher levels of care throughout the casualty evacuation system. As such, medical centers are becoming more accustomed to managing the deleterious late consequences of combat trauma related to the dysregulation of the immune system. In this review, we aim to highlight these late consequences and identify areas for future research and therapeutic strategies. Trauma leads to the dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which places the injured at risk for several late consequences, including delayed wound healing, late onset sepsis and infection, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are significant for their association with the increased morbidity and mortality of wounded personnel. The mechanisms by which these consequences develop are complex but include an imbalance of the immune system leading to robust inflammatory responses, triggered by the presence of damage-associated molecules and other immune-modifying agents following trauma. Treatment strategies to improve outcomes have been difficult to develop as the immunophenotype of injured personnel following trauma is variable, fluid and difficult to determine. As more information regarding the triggers that lead to immune dysfunction following trauma is elucidated, it may be possible to identify the immunophenotype of injured personnel and provide targeted treatments to reduce the late consequences of trauma, which are known to lead to significant morbidity and mortality.",0,"Late immune consequences of combat trauma: a review of trauma-related immune dysfunction and potential therapies With improvements in personnel and vehicular body armor, robust casualty evacuation capabilities, and damage control resuscitation strategies, more combat casualties are surviving to reach higher levels of care throughout the casualty evacuation system.

Neonatal Genetic Delivery of Anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Antibody by Non-Human Primate-Based Adenoviral Vector to Provide Protection against RSV,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infection in infants. Immunoprophylaxis with the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk for RSV-related hospitalizations, but its use is restricted to high-risk infants due to the high costs. In this study, we investigated if genetic delivery of anti-RSV antibody to neonatal mice by chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 expressing the murine form of palivizumab (AdC7αRSV) can provide protection against RSV. Intranasal and intramuscular administration of AdC7αRSV to adult mice resulted in similar levels of anti-RSV IgG in the serum. However, only intranasal administration resulted in detectable levels of anti-RSV IgG in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Intranasal administration of AdC7αRSV provided protection against subsequent RSV challenge. Expression of the anti-RSV antibody was prolonged following intranasal administration of AdC7αRSV to neonatal mice. Protection against RSV was confirmed at 6 weeks of age. These data suggest that neonatal genetic delivery of anti-RSV antibody by AdC7αRSV can provide protection against RSV.",0,"Neonatal Genetic Delivery of Anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Antibody by Non-Human Primate-Based Adenoviral Vector to Provide Protection against RSV Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infection in infants.

Identification of potential drug targets by subtractive genome analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7: an in silico approach,"Bacterial enteric infections resulting in diarrhea, dysentery, or enteric fever constitute a huge public health problem, with more than a billion episodes of disease annually in developing and developed countries. In this study, the deadly agent of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was investigated with extensive computational approaches aimed at identifying novel and broad-spectrum antibiotic targets. A systematic in silico workflow consisting of comparative genomics, metabolic pathways analysis, and additional drug prioritizing parameters was used to identify novel drug targets that were essential for the pathogen’s survival but absent in its human host. Comparative genomic analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotated metabolic pathways identified 350 putative target proteins in E. coli O157:H7 which showed no similarity to human proteins. Further bio-informatic approaches including prediction of subcellular localization, calculation of molecular weight, and web-based investigation of 3D structural characteristics greatly aided in filtering the potential drug targets from 350 to 120. Ultimately, 44 non-homologous essential proteins of E. coli O157:H7 were prioritized and proved to have the eligibility to become novel broad-spectrum antibiotic targets and DNA polymerase III alpha (dnaE) was the top-ranked among these targets. Moreover, druggability of each of the identified drug targets was evaluated by the DrugBank database. In addition, 3D structure of the dnaE was modeled and explored further for in silico docking with ligands having potential druggability. Finally, we confirmed that the compounds N-coeleneterazine and N-(1,4-dihydro-5H-tetrazol-5-ylidene)-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-2-sulfon-amide were the most suitable ligands of dnaE and hence proposed as the potential inhibitors of this target protein. The results of this study could facilitate the discovery and release of new and effective drugs against E. coli O157:H7 and other deadly human bacterial pathogens.",0,"Identification of potential drug targets by subtractive genome analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7: an in silico approach Bacterial enteric infections resulting in diarrhea, dysentery, or enteric fever constitute a huge public health problem, with more than a billion episodes of disease annually in developing and developed countries.
