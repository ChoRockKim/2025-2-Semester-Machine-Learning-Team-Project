Inhibition of cell adhesion to the virus by synthetic peptides of fiber knob of human adenovirus serotypes 2 and 3 and virus neutralisation by anti-peptide antibodies,"

This study provides insight into the possible role of fiber knob synthetic peptide fragments in inhibiting cell adhesion to human Adenovirus serotypes 2 and 3 (HAdV-2/3). Additionally, it also assesses the antigens’ ability to neutralise specific virus particles. To elucidate this relationship between fiber knob peptides and viral inhibition, biochemical assays were applied to determine vaccine potential by measuring antigen recognition responses against their respective antibody over a range of viral load conditions. The results obtained show that both anti-peptides recognised and bound specifically with HAdV-2/3 resulting in neutralization of those related viruses and foreshadow future work on developing an efficient vaccine for these two important human pathogens.

Title: Type I Interferon α/β Receptor-Mediated Signaling Negatively Regulates Antiviral Cytokine Responses in Murine Bone-Marrow-Derived Mast Cells and Protects the Cells from Virus-Induced Cell Death

Cytokines are pivotal for host defense against viral infection. Although mast cells play significant roles during virus infection, their regulation of cytokine responses by type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling has not been extensively studied. In this study, we analyzed the role of IFNAR signaling on antiviral cytokine production and cell death in murine bone marrow derivedmast cells (BMMC). We found that BMMC stimulation with polyI:C, an analog to viral RNA, induced secretion of multiple antiviral cytokines which was reduced upontreatment with neutralizing antibodies specific for mammalian type I interferons or knockdown by siRNA technology. Furthermore, we showed that conditioning with recombinant mouse IFNα inhibited polyI:C induced cell death via upregulation of antiapoptotic genes in BMMC suggesting important protective effects mediated by IFNAR signaling in these cells against incoming viruses. Our results demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism through which type I IFNR mediates negative control of antiviral cytokines while providing protective effects to BMMC during virus infections achieving coordinated biological outcomes among immune response activities.",1,"Type I Interferon α/β Receptor-Mediated Signaling Negatively Regulates Antiviral Cytokine Responses in Murine Bone-Marrow-Derived Mast Cells and Protects the Cells from Virus-Induced Cell Death

Rationality of 17 cities’ public perception of SARS and predictive model of psychological behavior,"

This study examines the rationality of public perception of SARS in 17 cities and proposes a predictive model for identifying psychological behavior. Using a sample size of 3000 participants, we observe public reaction to three distinct triggers – outbreak, awareness and contagion – while analyzing factors such as information sources, infectiousness risk assessments and knowledge acquisition trend across different demographics. The reasonable responses that emerged from these reactions were identified through situational characterizations based on established theories in preventive health behaviors. This was then used to establish a multi-level regression analysis to predict psychological behavior towards SARS given various scenarios. Through this process, findings indicate that social media appears to be an important source for acquiring information associated with epidemics such as SARS and may influence the way citizens respond according their individual understanding, leading us closer toward informed communicable disease control methods than previously thought possible.",1,"Rationality of 17 cities’ public perception of SARS and predictive model of psychological behavior

AVP‐IC(50)Pred: Multiple machine learning techniques‐based prediction of peptide antiviral activity in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)),"

This article presents a novel machine learning-based algorithm, AVP-IC(50)Pred, for predicting peptide antiviral activity in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)). By taking advantage of the new technologies and advances in data acquisition and retention, this algorithm is capable of incorporating multiple artificial intelligence approaches to obtain reliable predictions. The efficacy of AVP-IC(50)Pred has been evaluated using different datasets with application to five virus families classified by their RNA or DNA genome type. Results have shown that by combining three ensemble methods—boosting tree regression, random forest and support vector machines—further accuracy was obtained over single techniques analyzed separately.

Genetic Variability of Human Papillomavirus Type 39 Based on E6, E7 and L1 Genes in Southwest China
Human papillomavirus type 39 (HPV-39) is a genetically heterogeneous virus that harbors multiple variants. Understanding the sequence variability and its potential impact on HPV-39 pathogenesis is crucial to generating better predictive models for global epidemiology of diseases related to this virus. In this study, we characterized the genetic variability of HPV-39 among samples collected from a population living in Southwest China by analyzing three target genes -E6, E7 and L1. Through large scale sequencing we identified 17 unique subtypes belonging to different phylogenetic clusters with distinct geographical distributions that have not been previously reported. Overall our data suggests geographically driven genetic diversity but only weak evidence of antigens’ role on vaccine development or drug response success rates which emphasizes the need for further investigation into these populations in order to reduce HPV-related morbidity globally.",1,"Genetic variability of human papillomavirus type 39 based on E6, E7 and L1 genes in Southwest China

Rapid mitogen-induced aminopeptidase N surface expression in human T cells is dominated by mechanisms independent of de novo protein biosynthesis,"

Rapid changes in the surface expression of enzymes such as aminopeptidase N (APN) can dramatically alter immune cell signalling and thereby impact a wide range of T-cell pathologies. In this study, the authors investigated whether or not these alterations might be regulated by mechanisms independent of de novo protein biosynthesis following mitogen stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Through both single-cell tracking analyses and pharmacological approaches they found that APN upregulation upon stimulation is dominated by posttranslational modifications rather than via new protein synthesis; although at longer time points de novo synthesis begins to contribute to even higher levels of surface antigen expression. Taken together, their work suggests that most rapid dynamics are posttranscriptionally regulated - providing an important insight into how certain diseases involving aberrant T-cell immunity could be effectively treated through intervening on these signal regulatory pathways.",1,"Rapid mitogen-induced aminopeptidase N surface expression in human T cells is dominated by mechanisms independent of de novo protein biosynthesis

Targeting RIP Kinases in Chronic Inflammatory Disease,"

This study surveys the role of receptor interacting protein (RIP) kinases in chronic inflammatory diseases. RIP kinases are intracellular proteins involved primarily in inflammation and other immune system responses. Recent evidence suggests a possible role for RIP kinases as therapeutic targets in conditions that are difficult to treat due to their long-term, unregulated nature. This review aims to provide an overview of the current literature available on RIP kinases and how they may be exploited for potential treatments of three major chronic inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and vasculitis. The impact of such targeting methods will also be discussed relative to emerging trends in personalized medicine enabling us with better understanding of this field which could lead to improved patient care with tailored treatments against these diseases.",1,"Targeting RIP Kinases in Chronic Inflammatory Disease

Lethal Nipah Virus Infection Induces Rapid Overexpression of CXCL10,"

The lethal Nipah virus, first identified in Malaysia in 1998 and now globalized, is a zoonotic pathogen for humans. This study focuses on the remarkable rapid over-expression of CXCL10—chemokine ligand 10—in individuals affected by the virus. Using cell culture models coupled with highly sensitive ELISA assays, we demonstrated that exposure to nipah mediated through silent transmission systems such as aerosols or respiratory secretions triggers cellular response pathways leading to increased production of CXCL10. Our results emphasize an urgent need to develop targeted therapies that target not only the Nipah virus but also this upregulated chemokine secretion pathway associated with fatal infection symptoms. We propose a prophylactic strategy combined with extensive vaccination programs which may reduce human exposure and deaths due to Nipah Virus Infection.",1,"Lethal Nipah Virus Infection Induces Rapid Overexpression of CXCL10

Effect of insoluble fiber supplementation applied at different ages on digestive organ weight and digestive enzymes of layer-strain poultry,"

The title of this study is ‘Effect of Insoluble Fiber Supplementation Applied at Different Ages on Digestive Organ Weight and Digestive Enzymes of Layer-Strain Poultry’. It is widely accepted that dietary fiber plays an important role in both poultry growth and digestive health. To investigate the effect of insoluble fiber supplementation used on different ages applied to layer-strain poultry, this study aimed to analyze the impact on body weight gain as well as digestive organ weight and activity levels of key digestive enzymes from 90 broiler chickens. The total number was split into 3 groups (30 chickens per group) with one group receiving feed pellets supplemented with 5% insoluble fiber for starters (1-21 days), another group for growers (22–42 days) and feed pellets without supplement for finishers (43–90 days). Data obtained were analyzed by ANOVA method using IBM SPSS Version 20 software package. Our results showed that supplemental inclusion significantly increased abdominal fat index while decreased intestinal bacterial count in starter phase only leading to no significant difference in relative weights between ages overall. Moreover, enzyme activities within stomach gland contents, except low Pepsin A levels across all three dosages given, did not show major differences among groups either after 6 days posthatch or over two weeks later during 42nd day period suggesting that insoluble fibers had minor effects when fed throughout three stages but may still beneficially alter birds' performance under other treatments if given preliminary controls such as energy balance or live microbial content possibility remains likely driven by changes in gut microbiota composition differently impacted through life cycle of broiler chickens.",1,"Effect of insoluble fiber supplementation applied at different ages on digestive organ weight and digestive enzymes of layer-strain poultry

"Habitat structure is more important than vegetation composition for local‐level management of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species living in urban remnants: A case study from Brisbane, Australia","

'Habitat structure is more important than vegetation composition for local‐level management of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species living in urban remnants: A case study from Brisbane, Australia': An examination of the relative importance of habitat structure and vegetation composition on the distribution patterns and abundances of selected native reptiles and small mammals inhabiting remnant patches within an urban environment in Brisbane was conducted. Utilising four sites within each of two 5 km zone grid squares around central metropolitan parks as a basis for comparison; at each site a transect line (100m) was surveyed with Reptile Rogue Index values then used to estimate herpetofaunal richness across all eight sites. Correlations between various plant community parameters, microhabitat variables such as brush pile density, tree hollow density per hectare were also analyzed along with insect abundance data. Results suggest that while both heterogeneity in vegetation composition including shrub cover, grassy areas and woodland components are important determinants for adult reptile presence; other interactions such as predators strongly influenced by remnant connectivity could likely have significant impacts on affected demographics. This underscores how important it is to consider smaller-scale habitat variables when creating local-level conservation plans for imperiled taxa located in highly fragmented landscapes where resources can be poor but opportunities plentiful if implemented correctly.",1,"Habitat structure is more important than vegetation composition for local‐level management of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species living in urban remnants: A case study from Brisbane, Australia

"Genome sequence, transcriptome, and annotation of rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis N67","

This study presents the genome sequence, transcriptome and annotation of Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis N67: a rodent malaria parasite from Nigeria that has been widely used as an infection model to understand human malaria. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq X sequencing technology and de novo transcripts were identified by deep RNA sequencing on the same platform. However, instead of simply analyzing previously known data, these datasets were combined with other sources such as proteins and conservation track selections in order to expand upon existing annotations. The results are supplemented with proteomic analysis and additional evolutionary studies to further characterize this mutationally diversified strain and its role in human infection models. Additionally, open source software tools are included for quick access to various biological functions including automated annotation prediction pipelines to process custom samples at large scales efficiently. In conclusion, the present work not only provides important insight into Pyo N67 genomes but also demonstrates how high throughput technologies can enhance our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with rodents modeling human disease conditions more generally.",1,"Genome sequence, transcriptome, and annotation of rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis N67

The effect of adjuvants on vaccine-induced antibody response against influenza in aged mice,"

This study tested the effects of adjuvants on vaccine-induced antibody responses against influenza in aged mice. Aging is a major risk factor associated with decreased immunogenicity and increased morbidity related to acute viral respiratory infections, such as influenza. Adjuvants are components that are added to vaccines for enhancing the effectiveness of immunization; however, little is known about how their effectiveness may be modulated by age-associated immune senescence in elderly individuals. This research analyzed the effect of two different adjuvants (Alhydrogel and CpG) on serum levels of IgG antibodies from elderly mice receiving an Influenza virus challenge after vaccination via intramuscular injection. Results suggest that pre-existing immunity can impact the response elicited by adjuvant addition, raising important implications for older people's health strategies during seasonal influenza epidemics worldwide.",1,"The effect of adjuvants on vaccine-induced antibody response against influenza in aged mice

"Viral Disease, Air Pollutants, Nanoparticles, and Asthma","

This study seeks to understand the relationship between asthma and exposure to viral disease, air pollutants, and nanoparticles. While asthma is a common inflammatory respiratory illness of unknown etiology, several factors including indoor and outdoor exposures may contribute to its occurrence. Viral infections have been associated with acute exacerbations in almost 80% of asthmatic patients, while the inhalation of air pollutants has been linked to lung dysfunction in both children and adults. Moreover, recent studies suggest that airborne nanosized particles can be harmful when inhaled by human beings as they are able to pass through biological barriers undetected and cause adverse effects in pulmonary tissue. This systematic review will evaluate multiple scientific articles studying this relationship for evidence-based conclusions about the association between various environmental exposures and asthma manifestation or exacerbation.",1,"Viral Disease, Air Pollutants, Nanoparticles, and Asthma

Secreted production of an elastin-like polypeptide by Pichia pastoris,"

This article presents a study on the secreted production of an elastin-like polypeptide by Pichia pastoris. Elastin, a major extracellular matrix component essential for connective tissue functioning, has been found to demonstrate similar properties to that of mammalian elastins when produced through microbial expression systems. In this work we describe the transient expression and secretion of an elastin-like polypeptide with high degree of identity (80%) compared to human native elastun in bioreactor cultures of P. pastoris expressing pGAPZαA1 fused gene optimized for recombinant production from artificial genes derived from repeat elements originally identified in vertebrate genomes. We report successful applications and indicate the importance for future studies related to therapeutic interventions targeting regenerative medicine using these novel materials which can be potentially used as substitute or scaffold material due to its numerous biocompatible properties combined with its regular structure well characterized after purification by affinity chromatography using avidin/biotin interaction as anchor compound.",1,"Secreted production of an elastin-like polypeptide by Pichia pastoris

Antiparasitic DNA vaccines in 21(st) century,"

Antiparasitic DNA vaccines have emerged as a promising tool for controlling and eliminating infectious diseases in this 21(st) century. Although traditional parasite-based treatments are effective, they can be expensive and cause adverse reactions due to the multiple stages of parasites present in various hosts. Additionally, treatment strategies may become less effective owing to the increasing emergence of drug resistance amongst parasites. Thus, gene-based approaches such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and DNA vaccination techniques provide an attractive alternative approach by targeting specific parasites at different points in their life cycle with greater efficacy while also avoiding issues associated with antibiotic resistance. This review will examine recent advances made in antiparasitic DNA vaccine research from its origins over two decades ago up until now, looking into their developments both within epidemiology models and laboratory based experiments; encompassing topics such as mechanism of action, stability considerations including immunogenic potentials for the expressed antigens that vary among host species versus vector species; additionally clinical trials designed to assess safety and immune responses induced via administration methods.",1,"Antiparasitic DNA vaccines in 21(st) century

Brain tumor segmentation based on deep learning and an attention mechanism using MRI multi-modalities brain images,"

The accuracy of deep learning (DL) in segmenting brain tumors is limited by the complexity and heterogeneity of tumor-bearing tissues. To improve this, this paper proposes a new methodology to perform brain tumor segmentation based on DL with an attention mechanism using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) multi-modalities brain images. The proposed method combines 3D convolution neural network (CNNs), fully connected networks, and online hard sample mining for effective feature extraction from MRI images. In addition, an attention module with class activation map was used to localize suspicious lesions and serve as a guide for accurate segmentation results. An extensive evaluation study demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieved better performance than existing methods when tested on various datasets from publicly available databases such as the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Challenge (MSDC). This indicates that our approach is highly reliable in accurately distinguishing small variations between healthy tissues and areas affected by tumors. Our novel combination of DL tools could potentially help radiologists perform more precise diagnostic interpretation of brain tumor MRI scans in clinical settings.",1,"Brain tumor segmentation based on deep learning and an attention mechanism using MRI multi-modalities brain images

Loss-of-function tolerance of enhancers in the human genome,"

The dynamic nature of genetic elements with respect to gene expression alterations is widely accepted. However, it remains uncertain as to how much change certain genomic elements can tolerate before losing their regulatory potency. This study examines the loss-of-function tolerance of enhancers in the human genome and investigates whether such changes lead to any observable shifts in the regulated genes’ transcriptomic landscape. By taking advantage of a combination of epigenomics data, chromatin conformation capture, binding assays and differential expression profiling we were able to uncover aspects of tolerances between transcription factor binding sites and other putative cis-regulatory motifs over long evolutionary timescales. Our results suggest that enhancers are generally tolerant to most functional changes arising from single or multiple point surrogates within their sequence or structural composition while remaining capable of performing fundamental regulatory roles in vivo.",1,"Loss-of-function tolerance of enhancers in the human genome

Title: Biophysical studies of a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex binding to DNA and RNA
A scientific breakthrough in the understanding of nucleic acid structure’s influence on binding behaviors was achieved through biophysical study of a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex. This research document investigates how changes in the structure, conformation and orientation of nucleic acids influence their interaction with the ruthenium-complex by employing analytical techniques such as circular dichroism spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and optical absorption spectra. Results obtained showed that molecules bind differently depending on features of nucleic acid sequences they interact with while also identifying specific sequences where more pronounced differences were found. These findings hold implications for rational drug design targeting secondary structures like those proposed by G-quadruplexes. In conclusion, it is evident that compared to other biological targets, there are much greater structural effects seen when so called ‘non-specific’ interactions do indeed occur between the Ru(II)-polypyridyl complexes and different types or strands of genetic material (DNA & RNA).",1,"Biophysical studies of a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex binding to DNA and RNA prove that nucleic acid structure has significant effects on binding behaviors

Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona strains isolated from river buffaloes,"

A novel study detailing the Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona (L. Pomona) strains isolated from river buffalo is presented in this journal. Five bulls, 14 cows and 4 calves results were reported, with 72% of them showing positive L. Pomona presence using a modified microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Additionally, the occurrence of suspect leptospirosis was higher in old animals rather than youngsters or pregnant females which may be linked to their different behaviour when accessing waterbodies, age-related immune deficiency or antibodies production rate among other factors being taken into consideration for further investigation. In addition to bacterial isolation performed by cultivation method, four hypervariable regions (hv1-hv4) of LipL32 gene present in these samples were sequenced and BLAST/NCBI inferred that they belonged to L. pomona species; obtaining an identity score greater than 99%. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed five distinct subgroups evolving along two main branches containing both Brazilian and South African strains; these data strongly support previous hypothesis about an independently acquired pathogen strain specific to the Asian countries following a zoonotic cycle between water buffalo herds and environment contaminated waters over generations ago.",1,"Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona strains isolated from river buffaloes

Distal Pancreatectomy with Celiac Axis Resection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"

Distal Pancreatectomy with Celiac Axis Resection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 
Background: Distal pancreatectomies are effective surgical treatments for pancreatic cancer. However, complications such as bleeding at the celiac axis trunk may occur during this procedure. To optimize outcomes of these procedures, it is important to investigate any possible effects of concurrent celiac axis resection on clinical outcomes. 

Objective: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature investigating the association between distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection (DPACAR) and clinical outcomes postoperatively in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer treated surgically. 

Methods/Result: PubMed and Other Articles Database were searched from January 2002 to December 2020 for studies conducted on DPACAR in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer treated via surgery.

Distal Pancreatectomy with Celiac Axis Resection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 
Background: Distal pancreatectomies are effective surgical treatments for pancreatic cancer. However, complications such as bleeding at the celiac axis trunk may occur during this procedure. To optimize outcomes of these procedures, it is important to investigate any possible effects of concurrent celiac axis resection on clinical outcomes. 

Objective: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature investigating the association between distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection (DPACAR) and clinical outcomes postoperatively in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer treated surgically. 

Methods/Result: PubMed and Other Articles Database were searched from January 2002 to December 2020 for studies conducted on DPACAR in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer treated via surgery. Of 873 articles isolated initially, 20 fully matched our inclusion criteria; 4 cohort studies and 16 case–control studies were entered into our analysis. No study reported statistically significant difference regarding overall survival or recurrence predictors associated with DPACAR for either cohort or control patient groups in the meta-analysis done through random effect model using Stata software version 15 (StataCorp., College Station TX).

An RT-PCR panel for rapid serotyping of dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 in human serum and mosquito on a field-deployable PCR system,"

Abstract: The objective of this study was to develop a rapid and field-deployable reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) panel for serotyping the four dengue virus serotypes 1–4 based on phosphoprotein gene sequences, using serum samples obtained from infected patients and mosquitoes as sources. A total of 30 samples collected from China were used; 20 virus isolates obtained from patient serum samples and 10 mosquito saliva samples. These were divided into three sets according to their sequences, consisting of five S1, seven S2 ,five S3, six S4 viruses in one set and the other two sets having partial overlapping sequences respectively . Comparative analysis revealed clearly different product sizes with high accuracy among all sets. Amplification results showed that RT-PCR targeting P genes yields higher sensitivity than conventional methods when used with high cycle numbers. Consequently, our study provides a novel approach towards developing a practical PCR system for rapid identification and typing of dengue viruses types 1–4 in human blood as well as employing it at field settings conveniently.",1,"An RT-PCR panel for rapid serotyping of dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 in human serum and mosquito on a field-deployable PCR system

CMV reactivation caused by methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS after esophagectomy,"

Abstract - The effects of Methylprednisolone therapy on reactivation of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and its clinical significance in post esophagectomy patients developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are studied. This retrospective observational study included 133 patients who underwent elective esophageal resection with post-operative ARDS between March 2015 to April 2019 at a single tertiary hospital. Diagnosis of CMV infection was established based on qualitative presence of viral DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and/or quantitative assessment for the presence or elevation of antibodies against CMV. Statistical analysis revealed that methylprednisolone was associated with higher odds ratio for prompt reactivation than no usage, implying importance of steroid optimization strategy to avoid increased risk for CMV reactivation after major thoracic surgical procedures such as extensive resection in esophagus. Though generally not considered life-threatening, careful monitoring is still needed due to potential clinical significance since immunosuppression can further increase risk for respiratory complications arising from cytomegalovirus infection along ARDS development pathophysiology after substantial surgery operations like an esophagectomy.",1,"CMV reactivation caused by methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS after esophagectomy

A delayed diagnosis of late-onset pulmonary hemorrhage in a toddler with Henoch-Schönlein purpura after regression of skin rash: A case report and literature review,"

This case report presents a delayed diagnosis of late-onset pulmonary hemorrhage in a toddler with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), which is an immunoglobulin A-associated vasculitis affecting the skin, joints and gastrointestinal tract. It is reported to rarely include poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis as well as respiratory organ involvement. Our patient showed only cutaneous manifestations at first, but after complete regression of skin rash an emergent dyspnea occurred due to pneumothorax resulting from acute hemoptysis caused by secondary pulmonary hemorrhage related to HSP. After reviewing medical literature, this is believed to be the second case report addressing such clinical condition and course of action for its treatment. In order to better understand pathophysiology of the disease early recognition or detection of uncertain symptoms should be particularly addressed in pediatric cases with presumptive HSP, thus that timely management could prevent further morbidity or mortality outcomes caused by similar conditions.",1,"A delayed diagnosis of late-onset pulmonary hemorrhage in a toddler with Henoch-Schönlein purpura after regression of skin rash: A case report and literature review

The Uptake and Use of Telemonitoring in Chronic Care Between 2014 and 2019: Nationwide Survey Among Patients and Health Care Professionals in the Netherlands,"

This study presents a nationwide survey of telemonitoring in chronic care, conducted between 2014 and 2019 in the Netherlands. The uptake and use of this relatively new technology was investigated among patients with long-term illnesses such as diabetes, asthma or depression, as well as healthcare professionals (HCPs). It consisted of phone interviews with 1045 respondents including 830 primary care HCPs and 215 chronically ill patients; data from 45 specialized chronic care units were also included. Results indicate that over 90% of both patients and HCPs view telemonitoring positively. Roughly 20% of all contacted primary care practices used some form of remote monitoring for their chronically ill populations during 2019, whereas only 6 clinics/units had adopted it by 2018. Recommendations include broader implementation to improve normative management processes across various medical backgrounds and disciplines found at the studied institutions. In conclusion, the results suggest an unexpectedly positive attitude towards the technology but limited application on practical level in the surveyed environment due to lack of awareness amongst stakeholders even after five years since its introduction into clinical practice.

Generation of Human Antigen-Specific Monoclonal IgM Antibodies Using Vaccinated “Human Immune System” Mice,"

The rapid advances in biotechnology have enabled the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with specific human antigen-binding capabilities, a valuable tool for medical immunology research. Herein, we present a novel method to generate mAb’s by using vaccinated “Human Immune System” mice - HITS mice. We developed an immunization protocol that led to strong IgM responses against four different model antigens and higher levels of class switched IgG responses as compared to conventional mouse models without any signs of hypergammaglobulinemia or manufacturing issue. This approach enables us to produce high affinity antigen-specific humanized monoclonal antibody for drug discovery applications such as therapeutic intervention development and vaccine engineering design. Our experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of generating robust mimics of the human immune response from these animals facilitating cost effective production strategies over conventional methods with improved accuracy and lower animal usage requirements.

Rapid Generation of a Recombinant Genotype VIII Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) Using Full-Length Synthetic cDNA,"

Recombinant viruses with altered phenotypes are widely used in vaccine development and animal health research. This study presents a novel technique for the rapid generation of recombinant Genotype VIII Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) using full-length synthetic cDNA. Using this method, NDV antigenomic cDNA was generated beginning from cloned open reading frames which represent all nine transcriptional units present in the genome, combined by overlap extension PCR into single full-length genes flanked by viral consensus sequences for infection amplification purpose. The whole process is quicker compared to traditional methods where unmodified nonsegmented cDNAs had to be produced individually from each naturally occurring virus gene segment. The resultant low fidelity cDNAs amplified with very high titer titers that are comparable to wildtype and infectious clones developed through standard protocols. With its relatively ease of use and cost effectiveness when compared to conventional cloning techniques focusing on large regions of bacterial vector plasmids, our proposed strategy could greatly facilitate fast generation of target NDVs particularly in molecular studies that require multiple reassemblies or manipulations at different genes or repeated challenge experiments involving distinct genotypes or reassortants thereof such as avian influenza H7N1s variants – concurrently introduceable heretofore not feasible by other means due multipoint genome assembly requirement.",1,"Rapid Generation of a Recombinant Genotype VIII Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) Using Full-Length Synthetic cDNA

Identification of a Highly Conserved H1 Subtype-Specific Epitope with Diagnostic Potential in the Hemagglutinin Protein of Influenza A Virus,"

This study describes the identification of a highly conserved epitope which was found to have diagnostic potential in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza A virus strains. By combining standard biochemical methods with laboratory-based environmental surveillance, scientists sought out to determine whether there existed any cross-reactive immunoreactivity that could predict viral characteristics amongst emerging and circulating H1 subtype viruses. Through PCR amplification and sequence analyses, an HA amino acid motif was defined as being highly conserved during nearly four decades of global influenza activity. Moreover, the research team designed peptides based on this discovered epitope and validated them against previously acquired antigenic maps of several clinical specimen tests used for disease diagnosis including Influenza A rapid assays and more complex sero-typing techniques. This novel polymorphic domain within the HA molecule is expected to advance vaccine design strategies targeting epidemiologically relevant glycoprotein antigens for diagnostics purposes.",1,"Identification of a Highly Conserved H1 Subtype-Specific Epitope with Diagnostic Potential in the Hemagglutinin Protein of Influenza A Virus

Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases: Biocomplexity as an Interdisciplinary Paradigm,"

The emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza, Zika virus, bacteria-resistant tuberculosis, dengue fever and HIV/AIDS have created a global health crisis. This complex phenomenon has become even more challenging due to rapid advancement in urbanization, demographic changes, climate change and international travel. In response to this pressing situation, the concept of biocomplexity has been proposed as an integral interdisciplinary paradigm for researchers from social sciences (Sciences) to measure the factors involved in disease outbreak risk. By integrating socio-cultural contexts with scientific data through systems models and network analysis techniques, biocomplexity creates multifaceted approaches to observe how components interact within any given system. Moreover it allows us to gain deeper understanding about how complex biological systems emerge from multiple subsystems including genetic alteration or microscopic interactions between organisms at nanoscale level which cannot be explained by single discipline alone. The holistic view provided by biocomplexity helps researchers identify problems promptly before these issues become serious public health concerns on a global scale.",1,"Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases: Biocomplexity as an Interdisciplinary Paradigm

"Inter-society consensus for the use of inhaled corticosteroids in infants, children and adolescents with airway diseases","

This article discusses the findings of a recent consensus between experts in pulmonary, pediatric and allergic disciplines to provide informed guidance on the safe and effective use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) for infants, children and adolescents with airway diseases. A comprehensive review of evidence from existing clinical trials was conducted to determine appropriate dosing strategies for ICS therapy. The ability to safely titrate ICS dosing with minimal risk exposure is especially important in young patients given their greater vulnerability to certain side effects. In addition, optimal quality of life considerations for each patient were accounted for when developing consensus recommendations related to monitoring parameters, frequency of office visits and avoidance or cessation strategies when adverse effects occur. Finally, collaborations among pulmonologists, allergists physicians and other health care stakeholders facilitated the development of a cohesive agreement on best practice standards around these controversial therapies.

Supervised pulmonary hypertension exercise rehabilitation (SPHERe): a study protocol for a multi-centre randomised control trial 

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increasingly recognised condition characterised by increased pressure in the pulmonary artery, leading to impaired cardiac function and severe morbidity. Exercise plays a key role in managing PH symptoms and improving quality of life; however, it is not currently adopted routinely as part of routine care. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of supervised pulmonary hypertension exercise rehabilitation against usual care alone, using an international multi-centre randomised controlled strategy. This research will seek to determine whether implementation of SPHERe leads to improved clinical outcomes compared with standard care us usual at 12 months follow up. A total sample size of 114 adults (n=57/group) with mild or moderate PH will be allocated randomly between two interventions: either supervised Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise Rehabilitation (SPHERe) or Usual Care Only (UCO). Our primary outcome measures include walking distance during a 6 minute walk test; New York Heart Association functional status classification; self-reported physical impairment measured through EQ-5D questionnaire; changes related ventricular end diastolic diameter measured through echocardiogram assessments. Secondary outcomes measures include health related quality of life assessed via St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire and further enhanced patient reported experiences including impact on respiratory difficulty frequency, intensity and duration.

Shedding of Infectious Borna Disease Virus-1 in Living Bicolored White-Toothed Shrews,"

The title of this study is 'Shedding of Infectious Borna Disease Virus-1 in Living Bicolored White-Toothed Shrews'. This experiment was conducted to determine the presence and shedding behavior of infectious Borna disease virus (BDV-1) in living bicolored white-toothed shrews by analyzing their saliva samples. Weaning age shrews from Hungary were used for the purpose of the experiment, which lasted a period of 16 weeks. The results were gathered using two tests, namely quantitative real time PCR with probes targeting separate viral proteins, or nested PCR targeting nucleoprotein gene fragment. It was observed that 20 out of 21 tested individuals had BDV-1 infection by qPCR, while 18/21 showed positive results via Nested PCR. Furthermore our data revealed that infected animals could be repeatedly detected by both qPCR and Nested over the course of observation period where some contagiousness events happened even after 10 weeks post initial detection. All together our data support that bicolored white touthed shrews are possible reservoirs for zoonotic transmission routes as they can accommodate and shed Infectious BDV- 1 over extended duration.",1,"Shedding of Infectious Borna Disease Virus-1 in Living Bicolored White-Toothed Shrews

Disruption of STAT6 Signal Promotes Cardiac Fibrosis Through the Mobilization and Transformation of CD11b(+) Immature Myeloid Cells," 

The escalating problem of cardiac dysfunction and diseases, such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, has become a major health concern in recent times. Current treatments are largely focused on symptom-relieving or disease progression-reducing strategies rather than addressing the underlying pathogenesis of the condition. Herein, we explore a novel mechanism by which disruption of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) contributes to cardiac fibrosis through mobilization and transformation of CD11b(+) immature myeloid cells. We demonstrate that STAT6-gene silencing using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mouse primary cardiomyocytes significantly enhances expression levels of both proinflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1β). Expression levels were further amplified with an increase in density dependent manner when these cultures were transfected with Stat6 siRNA via liposomal nanoparticles; this revealed dysregulation caused by nonlinear dose-response curves at different doses/concentrations. Lastly, we show an elevation in CD11b+ inflammatory cell accumulation activating c–Jun N–Terminal Kinase signaling pathways causing extensive cardiac fibrogenesis. Overall our findings describe for the first time how deregulation in STAT6 is associated with transforming developmentally arrested innate immune cells into inflammatory phenotype thereby leading to malignant degeneration during cardiac remodeling processes",1,"Disruption of STAT6 Signal Promotes Cardiac Fibrosis Through the Mobilization and Transformation of CD11b(+) Immature Myeloid Cells

Occurrence of pendelluft under pressure support ventilation in patients who failed a spontaneous breathing trial: an observational study,"

This observational study aims to identify the factors that influence pendelluft when pressure support ventilation (PSV) is applied in patients who have failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Pendelluft, a type of dead-space ventilation due to time asynchrony of flows during cycle transitions, has been associated with various indicators used to assess patient ventilator interaction. Spontaneous breathing trials remain effective tools for weaning patients from mechanical ventilation and PSV is often the chosen mode after a successfully completed SBT fails. However, little attention has been given to defining those conditions under which pendelluft may occur while using PSV following an unsuccessful SBT. The results of this investigation are necessary for clinicians assessing their patient’s response to different levels and types of support.

Strain-Specific Antagonism of the Human H1N1 Influenza A Virus against Equine Tetherin,"

The type I interferon response plays an important role in the regulation of host-mediated immune defense against influenza A virus (IAV) infection. In this study, we focus on the specific antagonism by human H1N1 Influenza A virus strain against equine tetherin, a novel membrane protein involved in cell surface antiviral immunity. We first screened different recombinant human H1N1 strains to identify the one most effective at inhibiting the production of tetherin. Subsequent experiments showed that this identified IAV affected not only its expression but also replication and infection capacity of transfected cells over-expressing tetherin protein when compared to control groups with or without transfection. Furthermore, genetic variability analysis revealed that there was correlation between anti-tetherin properties and certain polymorphisms in two proteins found on hemagglutinins HA2 and M2 proteins from the infectious viral particle respectively associated with viral entry into target cells. Our findings provide evidence for strain specificity interactions between human H1N1 IAV strain and equine tetherin which will help elucidate their respective physiological roles during infection processes as well as pave ways for further research towards development of therapeutic interventions targeting these molecules like vaccines or drugs specifically directed agains H1N1 viruses strain’s antagoinisim of equine tetherins.

Length of encapsidated cargo impacts stability and structure of in vitro assembled alphavirus core-like particles," 

""Length of Encapsidated Cargo Impact Stability and Structure of In vitro Assembled Alphavirus Core-Like Particles"" examines the kinetic stability and structure of in vitro assembled alphavirus core-like particles (CLPs) modified with variable length TatA1 ORF RNA cargo as a function temperature. This study allows us to understand how encapsidated cargo affects CLP assembly, which is essential for applications in nanomedicine such as drug delivery platforms. We used dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gel retardation assays and nucleosome dispersion assays (NDAs) to assess the conformational stability, relative fluorescence intensity, size distribution and transcript abundance respectively. Our results demonstrate that CLPs having shorter cargo display improved thermal stabilities compared to those bearing longer ones. Therefore, optimizing functional RNA lengths provides additional leverages not only for stabilizing large scale production of these therapeutic agents but also for increasing their overall cell transfection efficiency at an affordable cost.",1,"Length of encapsidated cargo impacts stability and structure of in vitro assembled alphavirus core-like particles

Development of Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Rapid and On-Site Detection of Avian Influenza Virus,"

Abstract
Avian influenza virus (AIV) is one of the most important zoonotic pathogens due to its ubiquity in poultry and ability for adaptation, leading to human pandemics. Traditional detection methods require preparation of samples, which limits their applicability for on-site use in many scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RTLAMP) assay applicable for AIV viral RNA detection directly from environmental swab samples without pretreatment using available portable equipment with low cost. The robustness and sensitivity of the method were evaluated comparing RTLAMP assays against traditional laboratory based PCR; performing amplification at single temperature conferring additional advantage towards field operation as multiple steps are avoided. Our results demonstrated 28 copies/µl where achieved by RTLAMP method while 100 copies/µl detected through conventional PCR,without any loss of specificity or reproducibility. We conclude that our novel development provides a powerful technique suitablefor on-site surveillance activities allowing rapid screening if outbreak situations accelerating further control measures requirements avoiding disease spread and reducing economic losses causedby avian influenza outbreaks.",1,"Development of Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Rapid and On-Site Detection of Avian Influenza Virus

Recent studies have shown that strand-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay can be used to detect the presence of arenavirus specific RNA molecules from infected cells. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a strand-specific quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay for accurate quantification of arenavirus genomic and antigenomic RNAs. Primers were designed to target conserved regions on the 3’ UTRs region of all known Old World Arenavirus (OWA), New World Arenavirus (NWA) species, based on their sequence heterogeneity analysis. This qRT-PCR method was then tested with different concentrations of OWA, NWA virus cell lysates using standard curves created with reference RNAs synthesized in vitro; results showed a linear correlation between Ct values obtained by normal qRT PCR method and the developed strand specific Q RT PCR assay. The detection limit determined by the assay could accurately measure low abundance transcript levels as low 0.12 copies/μl.

Parallel reductive genome evolution in Desulfovibrio ectosymbionts independently acquired by Trichonympha protists in the termite gut,"

The gut of the termite constitutes a complex and diverse microbial ecosystem harboring species adapted to living in anoxic, nitrogen limited conditions that can be found nowhere else on earth. In this ecosystem, two different facultatively symbiotic Desulfovibrio are able to persist as ectosymbionts independently acquired by Trichonympha protists. Here we report our findings on the comparison of their genomic content and evolution paralleling on other taxa using comparative analyses for gene acquisition, retention and loss. Our results indicate that genome evolution underwent major reductive processes determining core-genome reduction both between the phyla Proteobacteria (Desulfovibrio) and Excavata (Trichonympha), as well as within them. By analyzing reciprocal best BLAST hits amongst shared genes with key phylogenomics methods across hundreds of bacterial genomes from completely distinct environments we have been able to assess how adaptation and differential gene retention has taken place for these genomically reduced bacteria during evolutionary time scales which drive effective selection responding microbiome constraints under niche specialization inside termites guts.",1,"Parallel reductive genome evolution in Desulfovibrio ectosymbionts independently acquired by Trichonympha protists in the termite gut
