Systematic examination of low-intensity ultrasound parameters on human motor cortex excitability and behavior,"Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound (TUS) can non-invasively modulate human neural activity. We investigated how different fundamental sonication parameters influence the effects of TUS on the motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy subjects by probing cortico-cortical excitability and behavior. A low-intensity 500 kHz TUS transducer was coupled to a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil. TMS was delivered 10 ms before the end of TUS to the left M1 hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Varying acoustic parameters (pulse repetition frequency, duty cycle, and sonication duration) on motor-evoked potential amplitude were examined. Paired-pulse measures of cortical inhibition and facilitation, and performance on a visuomotor task was also assessed. TUS safely suppressed TMS-elicited motor cortical activity, with longer sonication durations and shorter duty cycles when delivered in a blocked paradigm. TUS increased GABA(A)-mediated short-interval intracortical inhibition and decreased reaction time on visuomotor task but not when controlled with TUS at near-somatosensory threshold intensity.",0,"Systematic examination of low-intensity ultrasound parameters on human motor cortex excitability and behavior Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound (TUS) can non-invasively modulate human neural activity.

An intermolecular RNA triplex provides insight into structural determinants for the pseudoknot stimulator of −1 ribosomal frameshifting,"An efficient −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal requires an RNA slippery sequence and a downstream RNA stimulator, and the hairpin-type pseudoknot is the most common stimulator. However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote −1 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several −1 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of −1 PRF. Structure-based mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the −1 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of base–triple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stem–loop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the −1 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate −1 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate −1 PRF. Furthermore, it suggests that −1 PRF, induced by an in-trans RNA via specific base–triple interactions with messenger RNAs, can be a plausible regulatory function for non-coding RNAs.",0,"An intermolecular RNA triplex provides insight into structural determinants for the pseudoknot stimulator of −1 ribosomal frameshifting An efficient −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal requires an RNA slippery sequence and a downstream RNA stimulator, and the hairpin-type pseudoknot is the most common stimulator.

"Establishment, optimisation and quantitation of a bioluminescent murine infection model of visceral leishmaniasis for systematic vaccine screening","Visceral leishmaniasis is an infectious parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum. The drugs currently used to treat visceral leishmaniasis suffer from toxicity and the emergence of parasite resistance, and so a better solution would be the development of an effective subunit vaccine; however, no approved vaccine currently exists. The comparative testing of a large number of vaccine candidates requires a quantitative and reproducible experimental murine infection model, but the parameters that influence infection pathology have not been systematically determined. To address this, we have established an infection model using a transgenic luciferase-expressing L. donovani parasite and longitudinally quantified the infections using in vivo bioluminescent imaging within individual mice. We examined the effects of varying the infection route, the site of adjuvant formulation administration, and standardised the parasite preparation and dose. We observed that the increase in parasite load within the liver during the first few weeks of infection was directly proportional to the parasite number in the initial inoculum. Finally, we show that immunity can be induced in pre-exposed animals that have resolved an initial infection. This murine infection model provides a platform for systematic subunit vaccine testing against visceral leishmaniasis.",0,"Establishment, optimisation and quantitation of a bioluminescent murine infection model of visceral leishmaniasis for systematic vaccine screening Visceral leishmaniasis is an infectious parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum.

Retention Strategies for Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Adults: A Rapid Evidence Review,"OBJECTIVES: Although medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) save lives, treatment retention remains challenging. Identification of interventions to improve MOUD retention is of interest to policymakers and researchers. On behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we conducted a rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from February 2009 through August 2019 for systematic reviews and randomized trials of care settings, services, logistical support, contingency management, health information technology (IT), extended-release (XR) formulations, and psychosocial interventions that assessed retention at least 3 months. RESULTS: Two systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included; most did not focus on retention as the primary outcome. Initiating MOUD in soon-to-be-released incarcerated people improved retention following release. Contingency management may improve retention using antagonist but not agonist MOUD. Retention with interventions integrating medical, psychiatric, social services, or IT did not differ from in-person treatment-as-usual approaches. Retention was comparable with XR- compared to daily buprenorphine formulations and conflicting with XR-naltrexone monthly injection compared to daily buprenorphine. Most psychosocial interventions did not improve retention. DISCUSSION: Consistent but sparse evidence supports criminal justice prerelease MOUD initiation, and contingency management interventions for antagonist MOUD. Integrating MOUD with medical, psychiatric, social services, delivering through IT, or administering via XR-MOUD formulations did not worsen retention. Fewer than half of the studies we identified focused on retention as a primary outcome. Studies used different measures of retention, making it difficult to compare effectiveness. Additional inquiry into the causes of low retention would inform future interventions.

Antibodies Against the Current Influenza A(H1N1) Vaccine Strain Do Not Protect Some Individuals From Infection With Contemporary Circulating Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Strains,"During the 2013–2014 influenza season, nearly all circulating 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) strains possessed an antigenically important mutation in hemagglutinin (K166Q). Here, we performed hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assays, using sera collected from 382 individuals prior to the 2013–2014 season, and we determined whether HAI titers were associated with protection from A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Protection was associated with HAI titers against an A(H1N1)pdm09 strain possessing the K166Q mutation but not with HAI titers against the current A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain, which lacks this mutation.

Diagnostic Knowledge in the Genetic Economy and Commerce,"On 5 December 2002 the Australian Senate passed the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, which regulates stem cell research. The bill introduces some restrictions with regard to the use of stored frozen embryos, which are not destined to be implanted. The bill states that only frozen embryos created before April 2002 can be used for research purposes, provided that the individuals whom these embryos relate to give their consent. The alternative to this restriction would have been no research at all, and this would have happened if the law had been stopped. The Australian scientists regarded the new law as a compromise that would undoubtedly slow down research, but not entirely stop it.",0,"Diagnostic Knowledge in the Genetic Economy and Commerce On 5 December 2002 the Australian Senate passed the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, which regulates stem cell research.

Dietary Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 and Zinc Oxide Stimulate Immune Reactions to Trivalent Influenza Vaccination in Pigs but Do Not Affect Virological Response upon Challenge Infection,"Swine influenza viruses (SIV) regularly cause significant disease in pigs worldwide. Since there is no causative treatment of SIV, we tested if probiotic Enterococcus (E.) faecium NCIMB 10415 or zinc (Zn) oxide as feed supplements provide beneficial effects upon SIV infection in piglets. Seventy-two weaned piglets were fed three different diets containing either E. faecium or different levels of Zn (2500 ppm, Zn(high); 50 ppm, Zn(low)). Half of the piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly (VAC) twice with an inactivated trivalent SIV vaccine, while all piglets were then infected intranasally with H3N2 SIV. Significantly higher weekly weight gains were observed in the E. faecium group before virus infection, and piglets in Zn(high) and E. faecium groups gained weight after infection while those in the control group (Zn(low)) lost weight. Using ELISA, we found significantly higher H3N2-specific antibody levels in the E. faecium+VAC group 2 days before and at the day of challenge infection as well as at 4 and 6 days after challenge infection. Higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were also observed in the Zn(high)+VAC and E. faecium+VAC groups at 0, 1 and 4 days after infection. However, there were no significant differences in virus shedding and lung lesions between the dietary groups. Using flow cytometry analysis significantly higher activated T helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentages in the PBMCs were detected in the Zn(high) and E. faecium groups at single time points after infection compared to the Zn(low) control group, but no prolonged effect was found. In the BAL cells no influence of dietary supplementation on immune cell percentages could be detected. Our results suggest that feeding high doses of zinc oxide and particularly E. faecium could beneficially influence humoral immune responses after vaccination and recovery from SIV infection, but not affect virus shedding and lung pathology.",0,"Dietary Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 and Zinc Oxide Stimulate Immune Reactions to Trivalent Influenza Vaccination in Pigs but Do Not Affect Virological Response upon Challenge Infection Swine influenza viruses (SIV) regularly cause significant disease in pigs worldwide.

Culture and differentiation of rabbit intestinal organoids and organoid-derived cell monolayers,"Organoids emulate many aspects of their parental tissue and are therefore used to study pathogen-host interactions and other complex biological processes. Here, we report a robust protocol for the isolation, maintenance and differentiation of rabbit small intestinal organoids and organoid-derived cell monolayers. Our rabbit intestinal spheroid and monolayer cultures grew most efficiently in L-WRN-conditioned medium that contained Wnt, R-spondin and Noggin, and that had been supplemented with ROCK and TGF-β inhibitors. Organoid and monolayer differentiation was initiated by reducing the concentration of the L-WRN-conditioned medium and by adding ROCK and Notch signalling inhibitors. Immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR demonstrated that our organoids contained enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, goblet cells and Paneth cells. Finally, we infected rabbit organoids with Rabbit calicivirus Australia-1, an enterotropic lagovirus that—like many other caliciviruses—does not grow in conventional cell culture. Despite testing various conditions for inoculation, we did not detect any evidence of virus replication, suggesting either that our organoids do not contain suitable host cell types or that additional co-factors are required for a productive infection of rabbit organoids with Rabbit calicivirus Australia-1.",0,"Culture and differentiation of rabbit intestinal organoids and organoid-derived cell monolayers Organoids emulate many aspects of their parental tissue and are therefore used to study pathogen-host interactions and other complex biological processes.

Factors Associated With Influential Health-Promoting Messages on Social Media: Content Analysis of Sina Weibo,"BACKGROUND: Social media is a powerful tool for the dissemination of health messages. However, few studies have focused on the factors that improve the influence of health messages on social media. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of goal-framing effects, information organizing, and the use of pictures or videos in health-promoting messages, we conducted a case study of Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China. METHODS: Literature review and expert discussion were used to determine the health themes of childhood obesity, smoking, and cancer. Web crawler technology was employed to capture data on health-promoting messages. We used the number of retweets, comments, and likes to evaluate the influence of a message. Statistical analysis was then conducted after manual coding. Specifically, binary logistic regression was used for the data analyses. RESULTS: We crawled 20,799 Sina Weibo messages and selected 389 health-promoting messages for this study. Results indicated that the use of gain-framed messages could improve the influence of messages regarding childhood obesity (P<.001), smoking (P=.03), and cancer (P<.001). Statistical expressions could improve the influence of messages about childhood obesity (P=.02), smoking (P=.002), and cancer (P<.001). However, the use of videos significantly improved the influence of health-promoting messages only for the smoking-related messages (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that gain-framed messages and statistical expressions can be successful strategies to improve the influence of messages. Moreover, appropriate pictures and videos should be added as much as possible when generating health-promoting messages.",0,"Factors Associated With Influential Health-Promoting Messages on Social Media: Content Analysis of Sina Weibo BACKGROUND: Social media is a powerful tool for the dissemination of health messages.

Iron Deficiency in Obesity and after Bariatric Surgery,"Iron deficiency (ID) is particularly frequent in obese patients due to increased circulating levels of acute-phase reactant hepcidin and adiposity-associated inflammation. Inflammation in obese subjects is closely related to ID. It induces reduced iron absorption correlated to the inhibition of duodenal ferroportin expression, parallel to the increased concentrations of hepcidin. Obese subjects often get decreased inflammatory response after bariatric surgery, accompanied by decreased serum hepcidin and therefore improved iron absorption. Bariatric surgery can induce the mitigation or resolution of obesity-associated complications, such as hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, adjusting many parameters in the metabolism. However, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy can induce malabsorption and may accentuate ID. The present review explores the burden and characteristics of ID and anemia in obese patients after bariatric surgery, accounting for gastric bypass technique (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass—RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). After bariatric surgery, obese subjects’ iron status should be monitored, and they should be motivated to use adequate and recommended iron supplementation.",0,"Iron Deficiency in Obesity and after Bariatric Surgery Iron deficiency (ID) is particularly frequent in obese patients due to increased circulating levels of acute-phase reactant hepcidin and adiposity-associated inflammation.

"Imaging, Tracking and Computational Analyses of Virus Entry and Egress with the Cytoskeleton","Viruses have a dual nature: particles are “passive substances” lacking chemical energy transformation, whereas infected cells are “active substances” turning-over energy. How passive viral substances convert to active substances, comprising viral replication and assembly compartments has been of intense interest to virologists, cell and molecular biologists and immunologists. Infection starts with virus entry into a susceptible cell and delivers the viral genome to the replication site. This is a multi-step process, and involves the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. Likewise, the egress of progeny virus particles from the replication site to the extracellular space is enhanced by the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. This overcomes the limitation of thermal diffusion, and transports virions and virion components, often in association with cellular organelles. This review explores how the analysis of viral trajectories informs about mechanisms of infection. We discuss the methodology enabling researchers to visualize single virions in cells by fluorescence imaging and tracking. Virus visualization and tracking are increasingly enhanced by computational analyses of virus trajectories as well as in silico modeling. Combined approaches reveal previously unrecognized features of virus-infected cells. Using select examples of complementary methodology, we highlight the role of actin filaments and microtubules, and their associated motors in virus infections. In-depth studies of single virion dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolutions thereby provide deep insight into virus infection processes, and are a basis for uncovering underlying mechanisms of how cells function.",0,"Imaging, Tracking and Computational Analyses of Virus Entry and Egress with the Cytoskeleton Viruses have a dual nature: particles are “passive substances” lacking chemical energy transformation, whereas infected cells are “active substances” turning-over energy.

Molecular characterization of a novel recombinant strain of human astrovirus associated with gastroenteritis in children,"We report a naturally occurring human astrovirus (HAstV) strain detected in two different geographic locations. We identified two isolates of this strain in a diarrhea outbreak at a child care center in Houston, Texas; and two isolates in diarrhea stool samples from two children in Mexico City. All four isolates were detected in stool samples by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). One of the Mexican isolates was typed by EIA and all four isolates were HAstV-5 by typing RT-PCR. The four isolates were >97% nucleotide-identical in two different genomic regions: ORF1a (246nt), and the 3′ end of the genome (471nt). One isolate from each geographic location was further sequenced in the transition region from ORF1b to ORF2 (1255nt) and this region of the two isolates showed ≥ 99% nt identity. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of eight HAstV antigenic types and the novel strain in the transition region demonstrated the new strain being closely related to HAstV-3 in ORF1b, but closest to HAstV-5 in ORF2. These results and high sequence identity among all HAstV antigenic types in the transition region and RNA structural predictions supported a potential recombination site at the ORF1b/ORF2 junction.

"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3′-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells","Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21- to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3′-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.",0,"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3′-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction.

Cross-subtype Immunity against Avian Influenza in Persons Recently Vaccinated for Influenza,"Avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be transmitted to humans, resulting in a severe or fatal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian influenza (H5N1) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal influenza A (H1N1)/(H3N2). A small frequency of CD4 T cells specific for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against influenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors. No correlation between influenza-specific CD4 T cells and humoral responses was observed. N1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity, but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point. These findings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 by seasonal influenza vaccination.",0,"Cross-subtype Immunity against Avian Influenza in Persons Recently Vaccinated for Influenza Avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be transmitted to humans, resulting in a severe or fatal disease.

"Formulation of Colostrum Supplements, Colostrum Replacers and Acquisition of Passive Immunity in Neonatal Calves","Provision of an adequate mass of IgG from maternal colostrum is essential to health and survival of neonatal calves. Colostrum supplements (CS) have been developed to provide supplemental immunoglobulin when maternal colostrum is of poor quality. However, colostrum replacers (CR) that provide ≥100 g of IgG have not been formulated. Our objective was to determine the absorption of IgG in newborn calves fed CS derived from bovine serum or CR derived from bovine immunoglobulin concentrate. The CS were prepared by collecting, processing, and spray drying bovine serum and blending with other ingredients to provide 45 to 50 g of IgG per dose. The CR were prepared by further processing bovine serum to increase IgG concentration to >50% IgG and blending with other ingredients to provide 100 to 122 g of IgG per dose. Holstein calves (n = 160) were fed 90 to 244 g of IgG from CS or CR in 1 or 2 feedings in two experiments. Blood was collected from each calf by jugular venipuncture at 0 and 24 h of age and plasma IgG was determined by turbidimetric immunoassay. Apparent efficiency of IgG absorption was calculated. Plasma IgG concentrations at 24 h of age were indicative of IgG intake and averaged 5.5 to 14.1 g/L in calves fed CS and CR. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CS was 25 and 28% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CR ranged from 19 to 32% and were affected by method of processing and number of times fed.

Measuring Public Reaction to Violence Against Doctors in China: Interrupted Time Series Analysis of Media Reports,"BACKGROUND: Violence against doctors in China is a serious problem that has attracted attention from both domestic and international media. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates readers’ responses to media reports on violence against doctors to identify attitudes toward perpetrators and physicians and examine if such trends are influenced by national policies. METHODS: We searched 17 Chinese violence against doctors reports in international media sources from 2011 to 2020. We then tracked back the original reports and web crawled the 19,220 comments in China. To ascertain the possible turning point of public opinion, we searched violence against doctors–related policies from Tsinghua University ipolicy database from 2011 to 2020, and found 19 policies enacted by the Chinese central government aimed at alleviating the intense patient–physician relationship. We then conducted a series of interrupted time series analyses to examine the influence of these policies on public sentiment toward violence against doctors over time. RESULTS: The interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) showed that the change in public sentiment toward violence against doctors reports was temporally associated with government interventions. The declarations of 10 of the public policies were followed by increases in the proportion of online public opinion in support of doctors (average slope changes of 0.010, P<.05). A decline in the proportion of online public opinion that blamed doctors (average level change of –0.784, P<.05) followed the declaration of 3 policies. CONCLUSIONS: The government’s administrative interventions effectively shaped public opinion but only temporarily. Continued public policy interventions are needed to sustain the reduction of hostility toward medical doctors.",0,"Measuring Public Reaction to Violence Against Doctors in China: Interrupted Time Series Analysis of Media Reports BACKGROUND: Violence against doctors in China is a serious problem that has attracted attention from both domestic and international media.

Astrovirus Structure and Assembly,"Recent structural studies on the astrovirus virion and viral proteins have yielded exciting new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the astrovirus life cycle. The 25 Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) reconstructions of the astrovirus virion reveal a solid capsid shell studded with spikes. Proteolytic maturation of the virus particle results in capsid conformational changes, most prominently at the spikes. High-resolution crystal structures of the human and avian astrovirus capsid spike domains have shed light on potential host receptors and species specificity. Together, both the structural studies on the astrovirus virion and capsid spike domains have revealed similarities to hepatitis E virus, suggesting an evolutionary relationship. The only other structural information on astrovirus is from the high-resolution crystal structure of the protease that is involved in nonstructural polyprotein processing. Overall, these structural studies have led a better understanding of the astrovirus life cycle, including astrovirus assembly, virus release, maturation, receptor binding, antibody neutralization, and nonstructural polyprotein processing.",0,"Astrovirus Structure and Assembly Recent structural studies on the astrovirus virion and viral proteins have yielded exciting new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the astrovirus life cycle.

Inducing Brain Cooling Without Core Temperature Reduction in Pigs Using a Novel Nasopharyngeal Method: An Effectiveness and Safety Study,"BACKGROUND: Acute brain lesions constitute an alarming public health concern. Neuroprotective therapies have been implemented to stabilize, prevent, or reduce brain lesions, thus improving neurological outcomes and survival rates. Hypothermia is the most effective approach, mainly attributed to the reduction in cellular metabolic activity. Whole-body cooling is currently implemented by healthcare professionals; however, adverse events are frequent, limiting the potential benefits of therapeutic hypothermia. Therefore, selective methods have been developed to reduce adverse events while delivering neuroprotection. Nasopharyngeal approaches are the safest and most effective methods currently considered. Our primary objective was to determine the effects of a novel nasopharyngeal catheter on the brain temperature of pigs. METHODS: In this prospective, non-randomized, interventional experimental trial, 10 crossbred pigs underwent nasopharyngeal cooling for 60 min followed by 15 min of rewarming. Nasopharyngeal catheters were inserted into the left nostril and properly positioned at the nasopharyngeal cavity. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal cooling was associated with a decrease in brain temperature, which was more significant in the left cerebral hemisphere (p = 0.01). There was a reduction of 1.47 ± 0.86 °C in the first 5 min (p < 0.001), 2.45 ± 1.03 °C within 10 min (p < 0.001), and 4.45 ± 1.36 °C after 1 h (p < 0.001). The brain-core gradient was 4.57 ± 0.87 °C (p < 0.001). Rectal, esophageal, and pulmonary artery temperatures and brain and systemic hemodynamic parameters, remained stable during the procedure. Following brain cooling, values of oxygen partial pressure in brain tissue significantly decreased. No mucosal lesions were detected during nasal, pharyngeal, or oral inspection after nasopharyngeal catheter removal. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a novel nasopharyngeal cooling catheter effectively induced and maintained exclusive brain cooling when combined with effective counter-warming methods. Exclusive brain cooling was safe with no device-related local or systemic complications and may be desired in selected patient populations.",0,"Inducing Brain Cooling Without Core Temperature Reduction in Pigs Using a Novel Nasopharyngeal Method: An Effectiveness and Safety Study BACKGROUND: Acute brain lesions constitute an alarming public health concern.

Genetic diversity and recombination of enterovirus G strains in Japanese pigs: High prevalence of strains carrying a papain-like cysteine protease sequence in the enterovirus G population,"To study the genetic diversity of enterovirus G (EV-G) among Japanese pigs, metagenomics sequencing was performed on fecal samples from pigs with or without diarrhea, collected between 2014 and 2016. Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were >5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C–3A junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains.

Multiple Sclerosis: Immunopathology and Treatment Update,"The treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has changed over the last 20 years. All immunotherapeutic drugs target relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and it still remains a medical challenge in MS to develop a treatment for progressive forms. The most common injectable disease-modifying therapies in RRMS include β-interferons 1a or 1b and glatiramer acetate. However, one of the major challenges of injectable disease-modifying therapies has been poor treatment adherence with approximately 50% of patients discontinuing the therapy within the first year. Herein, we go back to the basics to understand the immunopathophysiology of MS to gain insights in the development of new improved drug treatments. We present current disease-modifying therapies (interferons, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, fingolimod, mitoxantrone), humanized monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab, ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab, daclizumab) and emerging immune modulating approaches (stem cells, DNA vaccines, nanoparticles, altered peptide ligands) for the treatment of MS.",0,"Multiple Sclerosis: Immunopathology and Treatment Update The treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has changed over the last 20 years.

A Neuron-Specific Antiviral Mechanism Prevents Lethal Flaviviral Infection of Mosquitoes,"Mosquitoes are natural vectors for many etiologic agents of human viral diseases. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses can persistently infect the mosquito central nervous system without causing dramatic pathology or influencing the mosquito behavior and lifespan. The mechanism by which the mosquito nervous system resists flaviviral infection is still largely unknown. Here we report that an Aedes aegypti homologue of the neural factor Hikaru genki (AaHig) efficiently restricts flavivirus infection of the central nervous system. AaHig was predominantly expressed in the mosquito nervous system and localized to the plasma membrane of neural cells. Functional blockade of AaHig enhanced Dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not Sindbis virus (SINV), replication in mosquito heads and consequently caused neural apoptosis and a dramatic reduction in the mosquito lifespan. Consistently, delivery of recombinant AaHig to mosquitoes reduced viral infection. Furthermore, the membrane-localized AaHig directly interfaced with a highly conserved motif in the surface envelope proteins of DENV and JEV, and consequently interrupted endocytic viral entry into mosquito cells. Loss of either plasma membrane targeting or virion-binding ability rendered AaHig nonfunctional. Interestingly, Culex pipien pallens Hig also demonstrated a prominent anti-flavivirus activity, suggesting a functionally conserved function for Hig. Our results demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism prevents lethal flaviviral infection of the central nervous system in mosquitoes, and thus may facilitate flaviviral transmission in nature.",0,"A Neuron-Specific Antiviral Mechanism Prevents Lethal Flaviviral Infection of Mosquitoes Mosquitoes are natural vectors for many etiologic agents of human viral diseases.

CXCR2 expression on granulocyte and macrophage progenitors under tumor conditions contributes to mo-MDSC generation via SAP18/ERK/STAT3,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) comprise a critical component of the tumor environment and CXCR2 reportedly plays a key role in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases. Here, CXCR2 expression on granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells (GMPs) was found to participate in myeloid cell differentiation within the tumor environment. In CXCR2-deficient tumor-bearing mice, GMPs exhibited fewer macrophage and dendritic cell progenitor cells than wild-type tumor-bearing mice, thereby decreasing monocytic MDSCs (mo-MDSCs) expansion. CXCR2 deficiency increased SAP18 expression in tumor-bearing mice, which reduced STAT3 phosphorylation through restraining ERK1/2 activation. Our findings reveal a critical role for CXCR2 in regulating hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation under tumor conditions, and SAP18 is a key negative regulator in this process.

"Broad-spectrum Investigational Agent GS-5734 for the Treatment of Ebola, MERS Coronavirus and Other Pathogenic Viral Infections with High Outbreak Potential","BACKGROUND: Recent viral outbreaks with significant mortality such as Ebola virus (EBOV), SARS-coronavirus (CoV), and MERS-CoV reinforced the need for effective antiviral therapeutics to control future epidemics. GS-5734 is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug in the development for treatment of EBOV. METHOD: Antiviral activity of GS-5734 has been established in vitro against a wide range of pathogenic RNA virus families, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses (EC(50) = 37 to 200 nM) (Warren et al., Nature 2016; Sheahan et al., Sci Transl Med 2017; Lo et al., Sci Rep 2017). Herein, we describe the in vivo translation of the broad-spectrum activity of GS-5734 in relevant animal disease models for Ebola, Marburg, MERS-CoV, and Nipah. RESULT: Therapeutic efficacy against multiple filoviruses with 80–100% survival was observed in rhesus monkeys infected with lethal doses of EBOV (Kikwit/1995 or Makona/2014) or Marburg virus and treated with once daily intravenous (IV) administration of 5 to 10 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 3 to 5 days post-infection (p.i.). In all rhesus monkey filovirus infection models, GS-5734 significantly reduced systemic viremia and ameliorated severe clinical disease signs and anatomic pathology. In mice infected with MERS-CoV, twice daily subcutaneous administration of 25 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 1 day p.i. significantly reduced lung viral load and improved respiratory function. In rhesus monkeys, once-daily IV administration of 5 mg/kg GS-5734 initiated 1 day prior to MERS-CoV infection reduced lung viral load, improved clinical disease signs, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. Finally, in African green monkeys infected with a lethal dose of Nipah virus therapeutic once-daily IV administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734, starting 1 day p.i. resulted in 100% survival to at least day 35 without any major respiratory or CNS symptoms. CONCLUSION: GS-5734 is currently being tested in a phase 2 study in male Ebola survivors with persistent viral RNA in semen. Lyophilized drug formulation has been developed that can be administered to humans via a 30-minutes IV infusion and does not require cold chain storage. Together, these results support further development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum antiviral to treat viral infections with high mortality and significant outbreak potential. DISCLOSURES: R.

In mice infected with MERS-CoV, twice daily subcutaneous administration of 25 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 1 day p.i. significantly reduced lung viral load and improved respiratory function. In rhesus monkeys, once-daily IV administration of 5 mg/kg GS-5734 initiated 1 day prior to MERS-CoV infection reduced lung viral load, improved clinical disease signs, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. Finally, in African green monkeys infected with a lethal dose of Nipah virus therapeutic once-daily IV administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734, starting 1 day p.i. resulted in 100% survival to at least day 35 without any major respiratory or CNS symptoms. CONCLUSION: GS-5734 is currently being tested in a phase 2 study in male Ebola survivors with persistent viral RNA in semen. Lyophilized drug formulation has been developed that can be administered to humans via a 30-minutes IV infusion and does not require cold chain storage. Together, these results support further development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum antiviral to treat viral infections with high mortality and significant outbreak potential. DISCLOSURES: R.

Methods for estimating disease transmission rates: Evaluating the precision of Poisson regression and two novel methods,"Precise estimates of disease transmission rates are critical for epidemiological simulation models. Most often these rates must be estimated from longitudinal field data, which are costly and time-consuming to conduct. Consequently, measures to reduce cost like increased sampling intervals or subsampling of the population are implemented. To assess the impact of such measures we implement two different SIS models to simulate disease transmission: A simple closed population model and a realistic dairy herd including population dynamics. We analyze the accuracy of different methods for estimating the transmission rate. We use data from the two simulation models and vary the sampling intervals and the size of the population sampled. We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals. We conclude that transmission rate estimates are easily biased, which is important to take into account when using these rates in simulation models.",0,"Methods for estimating disease transmission rates: Evaluating the precision of Poisson regression and two novel methods Precise estimates of disease transmission rates are critical for epidemiological simulation models.

Interferon-γ Inhibits Ebola Virus Infection,"Ebola virus outbreaks, such as the 2014 Makona epidemic in West Africa, are episodic and deadly. Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available. Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option. Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection. As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication. Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes. Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection. These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection. As treatment of interferon gamma robustly protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, we propose that interferon gamma should be further evaluated for its efficacy as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategy against filoviruses. Use of this FDA-approved drug could rapidly be deployed during future outbreaks.",0,"Interferon-γ Inhibits Ebola Virus Infection Ebola virus outbreaks, such as the 2014 Makona epidemic in West Africa, are episodic and deadly.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease at the Intersection of Autophagy and Immunity: Insights from Human Genetics,"Studies using human genetics have identified more than 160 loci that affect the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Several of these genes have been found to play key roles in the process of autophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway. Although historically considered to be a relatively nonselective process of degradation of cytosolic contents, autophagy has recently been revealed to have several selective and immune-specific functions that are relevant to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, including xenophagy, mitophagy, antigen presentation, secretion, and inflammasome regulation. In this chapter, we review the evidence that links autophagy-related genes, their immune-specific functions, and possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. We summarize the basic molecular events underlying general and selective autophagy, and present evidence suggesting possible pathogenic mechanisms revealed by studies of IBD-associated risk alleles of ATG16L1 and IRGM. Finally, we review chemical biology-based experimental approaches for identifying autophagy regulatory pathways that may have implications for the development of therapeutics.",0,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease at the Intersection of Autophagy and Immunity: Insights from Human Genetics Studies using human genetics have identified more than 160 loci that affect the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Analyzing Malaria Disease Using Effective Deep Learning Approach,"Medical tools used to bolster decision-making by medical specialists who offer malaria treatment include image processing equipment and a computer-aided diagnostic system. Malaria images can be employed to identify and detect malaria using these methods, in order to monitor the symptoms of malaria patients, although there may be atypical cases that need more time for an assessment. This research used 7000 images of Xception, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, NasNetMobile, VGG-16 and AlexNet models for verification and analysis. These are prevalent models that classify the image precision and use a rotational method to improve the performance of validation and the training dataset with convolutional neural network models. Xception, using the state of the art activation function (Mish) and optimizer (Nadam), improved the effectiveness, as found by the outcomes of the convolutional neural model evaluation of these models for classifying the malaria disease from thin blood smear images. In terms of the performance, recall, accuracy, precision, and F1 measure, a combined score of 99.28% was achieved. Consequently, 10% of all non-dataset training and testing images were evaluated utilizing this pattern.

Highly Pathogenic Influenza A(H5Nx) Viruses with Altered H5 Receptor-Binding Specificity,"Emergence and intercontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5Nx) virus clade 2.3.4.4 is unprecedented. H5N8 and H5N2 viruses have caused major economic losses in the poultry industry in Europe and North America, and lethal human infections with H5N6 virus have occurred in Asia. Knowledge of the evolution of receptor-binding specificity of these viruses, which might affect host range, is urgently needed. We report that emergence of these viruses is accompanied by a change in receptor-binding specificity. In contrast to ancestral clade 2.3.4 H5 proteins, novel clade 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins bind to fucosylated sialosides because of substitutions K222Q and S227R, which are unique for highly pathogenic influenza virus H5 proteins.

Inhibitory Effect of Lithospermic Acid on the HIV-1 Nucleocapsid Protein,"The HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) is a desirable target in antiretroviral therapy due to its high conservation among HIV-1 strains, and to its multiple and crucial roles in the HIV-1 replication cycle.

By coupling molecular modeling with NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence-based assays, we disclosed lithospermic acid, a catechol derivative extracted from Salvia miltiorrhizza, as a potent and chemically stable non-covalent inhibitor of the NC. Being different from other catechol derivative reported so far, lithospermic acid does not undergo spontaneous oxidation in physiological conditions, thus becoming a profitable starting point for the development of efficient NC inhibitors.",0,"Inhibitory Effect of Lithospermic Acid on the HIV-1 Nucleocapsid Protein The HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) is a desirable target in antiretroviral therapy due to its high conservation among HIV-1 strains, and to its multiple and crucial roles in the HIV-1 replication cycle.

Improving the Compliance of Intraoperative Antibiotic Redosing: A Quality Improvement Initiative,"INTRODUCTION: At Children’s Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the intraoperative antibiotic redosing guidelines and the time frame considered compliant for redosing were unclear. This lack of clarity plus an ill-defined process for ensuring intraoperative antibiotic redosing resulted in a compliance rate of 11%. The organization’s surgical site infection (SSI) rate was 3.19%, above the national benchmark of 1.87%. The primary project goal was to increase intraoperative antibiotic redosing compliance. The secondary project goal was to decrease SSIs. METHODS: With recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America, we developed new organizational redosing guidelines, as well as a new antibiotic-specific reminder alert in the electronic medical record. Implementation of the new guidelines and processes occurred after providing education to the anesthesiologists, surgeons, and circulating nurses. Monthly evaluation of data allowed for quick recognition of oversights followed by the initiation of process updates. RESULTS: Data showed that the initial compliance rate for the intraoperative redosing of antibiotics was 11%. Following interventions, compliance has reached and sustained an average of 99%. Survey results show that provider knowledge of the guidelines and process has improved. Though not directly related, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program observed that the SSI rate decreased from 3.19% in 2014 to 2.3% in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates that comprehensive education along with antibiotic-specific electronic medical record alerts significantly increased the compliance of intraoperative antibiotic redosing at Children’s Hospital & Medical Center.

Current obesity was associated with hypertension in children born very low birth weight,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies from the developed countries showed that children born very low birth weight have a higher risk of hypertension compared with that of the normal birth weight controls. However, studies regarding the prevalence of hypertension in such children from the developing countries are scarce. This study aimed to identify the perinatal and postnatal factors associated with hypertension in children born very low birth weight. RESULTS: Forty-six children aged ≥ 6 years from the VLBW cohort of Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand underwent the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The prevalence of hypertension was 15.2% (7/46). The hypertension group had a significant higher BMI z-score at 3 years of age (0.90 ± 1.44 vs − 0.45 ± 1.47, p = 0.045) and a greater proportion of current obesity (42% vs 2.5%, p < 0.01) compared to those in the normotensive group. Multivariate analysis revealed that current obesity was associated with hypertension (OR 34.77, 95%CI 1.814–666.5). Among 36 children with normal office blood pressure, four children (11.1%) had high blood pressure uncovered by ABPM, called “masked hypertension”.

Hemostatic Resuscitation,"Advances in surgical and critical care medicine frequently parallel the course of armed conflict. Indeed, surgery is a specialty born of warfare and will continue to drive advancements as mankind finds new and more lethal methods of combat. As hemorrhage is far and away the leading cause of potentially survivable death on the battlefield, the methods of resuscitation and blood transfusion continue to evolve. The critical role that blood plays in resuscitation of the critically injured patient was first explored during World War I for the treatment of ‘wound shock’. Type O whole blood was collected in sterile glass bottles containing citrate and transfused into patients prior to surgery. During the years following World War I, blood component fractionation became available, blood banking was initiated, and the transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets became a mainstay of the trauma management paradigm. However, in times of war the variable availability of short-lived platelets, FFP, and cryoprecipitate inevitably leads back to the resurrection of fresh whole blood transfusion. Fresh whole blood, though not without some risk, restores the hemostatic mechanism and provides volume and oxygen-carrying capacity.",0,"Hemostatic Resuscitation Advances in surgical and critical care medicine frequently parallel the course of armed conflict.

What’s the point? Domestic dogs’ sensitivity to the accuracy of human informants,"Dogs excel at understanding human social-communicative gestures like points and can distinguish between human informants who vary in characteristics such as knowledge or familiarity. This study explores if dogs, like human children, can use human social informants’ past accuracy when deciding whom to trust. Experiment 1 tested whether dogs would behave differently in the presence of an accurate (vs. inaccurate) informant. Dogs followed an accurate informant’s point significantly above chance. Further, when presented with an inaccurate point, dogs were more likely to ignore it and choose the correct location. Experiment 2 tested whether dogs could use informant past accuracy to selectively follow the point of the previously accurate informant. In test trials when informants simultaneously pointed at different locations (only one of which contained a treat), dogs chose the accurate informant at chance levels. Experiment 3 controlled for non-social task demands (e.g. understanding of hidden baiting and occlusion events) that may have influenced Experiment 2 performance. In test trials, dogs chose to follow the accurate (vs. inaccurate) informant. This suggests that like children, dogs may be able to use informants’ past accuracy when choosing between information sources.

"Invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease: Epidemiology, Pathogenesis and Management","Invasive group A streptococcal infections are uncommon, although serious, infections with high case fatality rates. Periodic resurgences in invasive group A streptococcal infections in industrialized countries have been reported from the 1980s onwards, with current estimates of incidence in these countries of approximately 3–4 per 100000 population. Infants, pregnant women and the elderly are at increased risk of invasive group A streptococcal infection. The group A streptococcus has an array of virulence factors that underpin its invasive capacity and, in approximately 10% of cases, super-antigen toxins produced by the bacteria stimulate a large proportion of T cells, leading to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Given the rapid clinical progression, effective management of invasive group A streptococcal infections hinges on early recognition of the disease and prompt initiation of supportive care (often intensive care) together with antibacterial therapy. In cases of toxic shock syndrome, it is often difficult to distinguish between streptococcal and staphylococcal infection before cultures become available and so antibacterial choice must include coverage of both of these organisms. In addition, clindamycin is an important adjunctive antibacterial because of its anti-toxin effects and excellent tissue penetration. Early institution of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy should be considered in cases of toxic shock syndrome and severe invasive infection, including necrotizing fasciitis. Early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is also an important part of management in cases of necrotizing fasciitis.",0,"Invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease: Epidemiology, Pathogenesis and Management Invasive group A streptococcal infections are uncommon, although serious, infections with high case fatality rates.

"Judging in the genomic era: judges’ genetic knowledge, confidence and need for training","Genetic information is increasingly used in many contexts, including health, insurance, policing and sentencing—with numerous potential benefits and risks. Protecting from the related risks requires updates to laws and procedures by justice systems. These updates depend to a large extent on what the key stakeholders—the judiciary—know and think about the use of genetic information. This study used a battery of 25 genetic knowledge items to collect data from 73 supreme court judges from the same country (Romania) on their knowledge of genetic information. Their responses were compared with those of two other groups: lawyers (but not judges; N = 94) and non-lawyers (N = 116) from the same country. The data were collected at approximately the same time from the three groups. The judges’ results were also compared to the results obtained from a general population data collection (N = 5310). The results showed that: (1) judges had overall better knowledge of genetics than the other groups, but their knowledge was uneven across different genetic concepts; (2) judges were overall more confident in their knowledge than the other two groups, but their confidence was quite low; and (3) the correlation between knowledge and confidence was moderate for judges, weak for lawyers and not significant for non-lawyers. Finally, 100% of the judges agreed that information on gene-environment processes should be included in judges’ training.

Successful respiratory management of a Marshall-Smith syndrome patient with a tracheo-innominate artery fistula,"BACKGROUND: Tracheo-innominate artery fistula (TIF) is a life-threatening complication of tracheostomy. We describe perioperative management for innominate artery transection in a case with TIF. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old Japanese female with Marshal-Smith syndrome presented for management of TIF. She underwent tracheostomy at the age of 3 months and an uncuffed tracheostomy tube was inserted. One month before admission to our hospital, intermittent tracheal bleeding, suggesting TIF, occurred. Although we considered to change to a cuffed endotracheal tube, craniofacial abnormality suggested difficult oral intubation, and there was a possibility of rebleeding. Finally, innominate artery transection was performed under total intravenous anesthesia without changing the tracheostomy tube. Surgery completed uneventfully and she received mechanical ventilation under sedation for a day, followed by weaning without complications. CONCLUSIONS: A cuffed tracheostomy tube should have been inserted before surgery for effective hemostasis against sudden bleeding from TIF even though conversion to oral intubation was difficult.",0,"Successful respiratory management of a Marshall-Smith syndrome patient with a tracheo-innominate artery fistula BACKGROUND: Tracheo-innominate artery fistula (TIF) is a life-threatening complication of tracheostomy.

"Trends in Food Sources and Diet Quality Among US Children and Adults, 2003-2018","IMPORTANCE: Time trends and population disparities in nutritional quality of foods from major US sources, including grocery stores, restaurants, schools, worksites, and other sources, are not well established. OBJECTIVE: To investigate patterns and trends in diet quality by food sources among US children and adults overall and in sociodemographic subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This serial, cross-sectional survey study included respondents from 8 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (2003-2018) with valid dietary recalls. Data were analyzed from April 16, 2020, to July 20, 2020. EXPOSURES: Survey cycle, food source, and key sociodemographic subgroups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean diet quality of foods (meals, snacks, and beverages) consumed per person, characterized by the American Heart Association diet score (range, 0-80, with higher scores indicating healthier diets), the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating healthier diets), and their components. For the American Heart Association diet score, poor diet was defined as less than 40.0% adherence (score, <32.0), intermediate diet as 40.0% to 79.9% adherence (score, 32.0-63.9), and ideal as 80.0% or greater adherence (score, ≥64.0). RESULTS: The study included 20 905 children 5 to 19 years of age (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [5.24] years; 51.0% male) and 39 757 adults 20 years or older (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [15.1] years; 51.9% female). Diet quality of foods consumed from grocery stores increased modestly in children (53.2% to 45.1% with poor diet quality; P = .006 for trend) and adults (40.1% to 32.9% with poor diet quality; P = .001 for trend), with smaller changes for restaurants among children (84.8% to 79.6% with poor diet quality; P = .003 for trend). Changes for restaurants among adults were not statistically significant (65.4% to 65.2% with poor diet quality; P = .07 with poor diet quality); the same was true of worksites (adults: 55.6% to 50.7% with poor diet quality; P = .25 for trend). Food quality from other sources worsened (children: 40.0% to 51.7% with poor diet quality; adults: 33.8% to 43.8% with poor diet quality; P < .001 for trend each). The largest improvement in diet quality was in schools, with the percentage with poor diet quality decreasing from 55.6% to 24.4% (P < .001 for trend), mostly after 2010, and with equitable improvements across population subgroups. Findings were similar for Healthy Eating Index 2015. Significant disparities in diet quality trends were seen by sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, and household income for food consumed from grocery stores. For example, the proportion of foods consumed from grocery stores that were of poor diet quality decreased among high-income adults (from 36.9% to 26.5%; P = .001 for trend) but not among low-income adults (from 45.8% to 41.3%; P = .09 for trend).

Effect of fexofenadine hydrochloride on allergic rhinitis aggravated by air pollutants,"In recent decades, seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) prevalence has increased and recent studies have shown that air pollutants, such as diesel exhaust particles (DEP), can increase inflammatory and allergic biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DEP on SAR symptoms induced by ragweed and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fexofenadine HCl 180 mg versus placebo. This phase 3, single-centre, sequential, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised study (NCT03664882) was conducted in an environmental exposure unit (EEU) during sequential exposures: Period 1 (ragweed pollen alone), Period 2 (ragweed pollen+DEP), and Period 3 (ragweed pollen+DEP+single-dose fexofenadine HCl 180 mg or placebo). Efficacy and safety were evaluated in Period 3. Primary endpoints were the area under the curve (AUC) of total nasal symptom score (TNSS) from baseline to hour 12 (AUC(0–12)) during Period 1 and Period 2; and the AUC of the TNSS from hour 2 to 12 (AUC(2–12)) during Period 3. 251 out of 257 evaluable subjects were included in the modified intent-to-treat population. Least squares mean difference (95% CI) for TNSS Log AUC(0−12) in Period 2 versus Period 1 was 0.13 (0.081–0.182; p<0.0001). Least squares mean difference in TNSS Log AUC(2−12) for fexofenadine HCl versus placebo during Period 3 was −0.24 (−0.425–−0.047; p=0.0148). One fexofenadine HCl-related adverse event was observed.

Primary endpoints were the area under the curve (AUC) of total nasal symptom score (TNSS) from baseline to hour 12 (AUC(0–12)) during Period 1 and Period 2; and the AUC of the TNSS from hour 2 to 12 (AUC(2–12)) during Period 3. 251 out of 257 evaluable subjects were included in the modified intent-to-treat population. Least squares mean difference (95% CI) for TNSS Log AUC(0−12) in Period 2 versus Period 1 was 0.13 (0.081–0.182; p<0.0001). Least squares mean difference in TNSS Log AUC(2−12) for fexofenadine HCl versus placebo during Period 3 was −0.24 (−0.425–−0.047; p=0.0148). One fexofenadine HCl-related adverse event was observed.

677. Using a Multisectoral One Health Approach to Prioritize Zoonotic Diseases in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Emerging and endemic zoonoses continue to have adverse global impacts. One Health approaches promoting multisectoral, transdisciplinary collaboration are important methods to address zoonoses threats through disease surveillance, prevention, control, and response. We conducted a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) workshop in the United States (US) to identify zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern that should be jointly addressed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of the Interior, and partners. METHODS: We used CDC’s OHZDP tool to prioritize zoonoses. Workshop participants selected criteria for prioritization, and developed questions and weights for each criterion. Questions were answered using available literature and expert opinion with subsequent scoring resulting in a ranked zoonotic disease list. After agreeing on a final prioritized disease list, participants used components of the One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit, developed by USDA and University of Minnesota, to review multidisciplinary coordination processes for the prioritized zoonotic diseases. RESULTS: Participants selected epidemic or pandemic potential, disease severity, economic impact, introduction or increased transmission potential, and national security as criteria to prioritize 56 zoonoses. The eight prioritized zoonotic diseases for the US were zoonotic influenzas, salmonellosis, West Nile virus, plague, emerging coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), rabies, brucellosis, and Lyme disease. Agencies then discussed recommendations to enhance One Health approaches to surveillance, response, prevention, and control of the prioritized zoonoses. Key themes and next steps for further implementation of One Health approaches were identified. CONCLUSION: This OHZDP workshop represents the first use of a One Health approach to zoonotic disease prioritization in the United States. It is a critical step forward in US government agency collaboration using One Health approaches. Further, the workshop created a foundation for future US government One Health systems strengthening for the prioritized zoonoses. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.",0,"677.

Acute and Persistent Viral Infections of Differentiated Nerve Cells,"Within the nervous system the highly specialized structure and function of nerve cells renders the pathogenesis of viral infections amazingly complex. In vivo and in vitro studies reveal that viruses may display tropism for distinct types of cells such as neurons, myelin-forming cells, or astrocytes. In neurons, RNA viruses mature in the cell body and in dendrites close to synapses, from which they can spread to synaptic endings. Undefined host factors and stage of differentiation may favor defective viral assembly, which, in turn, results in persistent infections of neurons. In myelin-forming cells, lytic infection results in degeneration of myelin and, consequently, in altered conduction in those axons that are ensheathed by a myelin-forming cell. In addition, breakdown of myelin may induce an autoimmune response, which then leads to further demyelination. Autoimmune demyelination may also occur when glial cells other than myelin-forming cells are infected. Astrocytes are prone to persistent infection or viral transformation.",0,"Acute and Persistent Viral Infections of Differentiated Nerve Cells Within the nervous system the highly specialized structure and function of nerve cells renders the pathogenesis of viral infections amazingly complex.

Evaluation of the role of exogenous pathogens on the incidence of embryo loss during early pregnancy in mice,"The mating of CBA/j♀ mice (H2(k)) by DBA/2j♂ mice (H2(d)) typically results in an elevated incidence of spontaneous embryo loss thus providing an ideal genetically controlled laboratory model for the study of the factors causing early embryo loss during pregnancy. There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j♀ × DBA/2j♂ matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption. It was concluded that the immunomodulatory effects of infection by common murine pathogens neither augmented nor reduced post-implantation embryo losses.",0,"Evaluation of the role of exogenous pathogens on the incidence of embryo loss during early pregnancy in mice The mating of CBA/j♀ mice (H2(k)) by DBA/2j♂ mice (H2(d)) typically results in an elevated incidence of spontaneous embryo loss thus providing an ideal genetically controlled laboratory model for the study of the factors causing early embryo loss during pregnancy.

The impact of sleep disorders on microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (SLEEP T2D): the protocol of a cohort study and feasibility randomised control trial,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is very common in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We and others have shown that OSA was associated with diabetes-related microvascular complications in patients with T2D in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and that compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduced the progression of microvascular complications. Hence, we hypothesised that adequate CPAP reduces the development of microvascular complication in patients with T2D. METHODS: SLEEP T2D is a cohort study with embedded feasibility, open-label, parallel-arm, randomised control trial (RCT) over 2 years. The primary aim is the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT assessing the impact of CPAP on chronic kidney disease and other microvascular complications in patients with T2D. The main parameters are to assess willingness of participants to be randomised, follow-up rates, CPAP adherence/compliance, to optimise the choice of outcome measures for a substantive trial, and to identify the parameters for sample size calculations. The secondary aims of the study are related to the impact of CPAP, sleep-related disorders, and sleep chronotype on a variety of diabetes-related end points. The study participants were recruited from the T2D services in multiple NHS trusts across England. The main exclusion criteria for the cohort study are as follows: T1D, eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), known OSA, active malignancy or chronic kidney disease from reasons other than diabetes, pregnancy, professional drivers, and a history of falling asleep whilst driving within last 2 years. The main exclusion criteria from the RCT were as follows: Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index < 10 and Epworth Sleepiness Score ≥ 11. Study participants were extensively phenotyped clinically and biochemically. The OSA diagnosis was based on multichannel portable device (ApneaLink Air(TM), Resmed). DISCUSSION: The feasibility RCT will help us design the future RCT to assess the impact of CPAP on diabetes-related microvascular complications. The cohort study will generate preliminary data regarding the impact of sleep quality, duration, and chronotype on diabetes-related outcomes which could lead to further mechanistic and interventional studies.

Viral Inhibition of the IFN-Induced JAK/STAT Signalling Pathway: Development of Live Attenuated Vaccines by Mutation of Viral-Encoded IFN-Antagonists,"The interferon (IFN) induced anti-viral response is amongst the earliest and most potent of the innate responses to fight viral infection. The induction of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway by IFNs leads to the upregulation of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) for which, many have the ability to rapidly kill viruses within infected cells. During the long course of evolution, viruses have evolved an extraordinary range of strategies to counteract the host immune responses in particular by targeting the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. Understanding how the IFN system is inhibited has provided critical insights into viral virulence and pathogenesis. Moreover, identification of factors encoded by viruses that modulate the JAK/STAT pathway has opened up opportunities to create new anti-viral drugs and rationally attenuated new generation vaccines, particularly for RNA viruses, by reverse genetics.",0,"Viral Inhibition of the IFN-Induced JAK/STAT Signalling Pathway: Development of Live Attenuated Vaccines by Mutation of Viral-Encoded IFN-Antagonists The interferon (IFN) induced anti-viral response is amongst the earliest and most potent of the innate responses to fight viral infection.

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Immune-Related Gene Expression in Duck Embryo Fibroblasts Following Duck Tembusu Virus Infection,"Duck is a major waterfowl species in China, providing high-economic benefit with a population of up to 20–30 billion per year. Ducks are commonly affected by severe diseases, including egg-drop syndrome caused by duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV). The immune mechanisms against DTMUV invasion and infection remain poorly understood. In this study, duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were infected with DTMUV and harvested at 12 and 24 h post-infection (hpi), and their genomes were sequenced. In total, 911 (764 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes) and 3008 (1791 upregulated and 1217 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were considerably enriched in immune-relevant pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Hematopoietic cell lineage at both time points. The key DEGs in immune system included those of the cytokines (IFN α2, IL-6, IL-8L, IL-12B, CCR7, CCL19, and CCL20), transcription factors or signaling molecules (IRF7, NF-κB, STAT1, TMEM173, and TNFAIP3), pattern recognition receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), and antigen-presenting proteins (CD44 and CD70). This suggests DTMUV infection induces strong proinflammatory/antiviral effects with enormous production of cytokines. However, these cytokines could not protect DEFs against viral attack. Our data revealed valuable transcriptional information regarding DTMUV-infected DEFs, thereby broadening our understanding of the immune response against DTMUV infection; this information might contribute in developing strategies for controlling the prevalence of DTMUV infection.",0,"Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Immune-Related Gene Expression in Duck Embryo Fibroblasts Following Duck Tembusu Virus Infection Duck is a major waterfowl species in China, providing high-economic benefit with a population of up to 20–30 billion per year.

Protective Immunity to Listeria Monocytogenes Infection Mediated by Recombinant Listeria innocua Harboring the VGC Locus,"In this study we propose a novel bacterial vaccine strategy where non-pathogenic bacteria are complemented with traits desirable for the induction of protective immunity. To illustrate the proof of principle of this novel vaccination strategy, we use the model organism of intracellular immunity Listeria. We introduced a, low copy number BAC-plasmid harbouring the virulence gene cluster (vgc) of L. monocytogenes (Lm) into the non-pathogenic L. innocua (L.inn) strain and examined for its ability to induce protective cellular immunity. The resulting strain (L.inn::vgc) was attenuated for virulence in vivo and showed a strongly reduced host detrimental inflammatory response compared to Lm. Like Lm, L.inn::vgc induced the production of Type I Interferon's and protection was mediated by Listeria-specific CD8(+) T cells. Rational vaccine design whereby avirulent strains are equipped with the capabilities to induce protection but lack detrimental inflammatory effects offer great promise towards future studies using non-pathogenic bacteria as vectors for vaccination.",0,"Protective Immunity to Listeria Monocytogenes Infection Mediated by Recombinant Listeria innocua Harboring the VGC Locus In this study we propose a novel bacterial vaccine strategy where non-pathogenic bacteria are complemented with traits desirable for the induction of protective immunity.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients receiving veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,"To identify the incidence, risk factors and impact on long-term survival of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and Aspergillus colonisation in patients receiving vv-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A retrospective evaluation was performed of patients receiving vv-ECMO at a tertiary hospital in Manchester (UK) between January 2012 and December 2016. Data collected included epidemiological data, microbiological cultures, radiographic findings and outcomes. Cases were classified as proven IPA, putative IPA or Aspergillus colonisation according to a validated clinical algorithm. One hundred thirty-four patients were supported with vv-ECMO, median age of 45.5 years (range 16.4–73.4). Ten (7%) patients had putative IPA and nine (7%) had Aspergillus colonisation. Half of the patients with putative IPA lacked classical host risk factors for IPA. The median number of days on ECMO prior to Aspergillus isolation was 5 days. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection were significantly associated with developing IPA in a logistic regression model. Cox regression model demonstrates a three times greater hazard of death associated with IPA. Overall 6-month mortality rate was 38%. Patients with putative IPA and colonised patients had a 6-month mortality rate of 80 and 11%, respectively. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection are independent risk factors for IPA.

Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States: 1999–2018,"Low intakes of fruits and vegetables have resulted in suboptimal intakes of several micronutrients, including vitamin C. This cross-sectional study used data from 84,902 children/adults (≥1 y) who completed a 24-h dietary recall as part of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2018). Mean vitamin C intakes from foods/beverages were calculated as were trends in major food/beverage sources of vitamin C. Percentages below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) were estimated. Overall, mean vitamin C consumption declined by 23% (97–75 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). 100% fruit juice was the leading source of vitamin C (25.6% of total or 21.7mg/d), but this declined by 48% (25–13 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). Whole fruit increased among children/adolescents (+75.8%;10–17 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001), but not adults, while the vegetable contribution was generally unchanged. The proportion of the population below the EAR increased by 23.8% on a relative scale or 9 percentage points on an absolute scale (38.3–47.4%). Declines in vitamin C intake is driven largely by decreases in fruit juice coupled with modest increases in whole fruit. Due to associations between vitamin C intake and numerous health outcomes these trends warrant careful monitoring moving forward.",0,"Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States: 1999–2018 Low intakes of fruits and vegetables have resulted in suboptimal intakes of several micronutrients, including vitamin C.

Cationic Nanoparticle-Based Cancer Vaccines,"Cationic nanoparticles have been shown to be surprisingly effective as cancer vaccine vehicles in preclinical and clinical studies. Cationic nanoparticles deliver tumor-associated antigens to dendritic cells and induce immune activation, resulting in strong antigen-specific cellular immune responses, as shown for a wide variety of vaccine candidates. In this review, we discuss the relation between the cationic nature of nanoparticles and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Multiple types of lipid- and polymer-based cationic nanoparticulate cancer vaccines with various antigen types (e.g., mRNA, DNA, peptides and proteins) and adjuvants are described. Furthermore, we focus on the types of cationic nanoparticles used for T-cell induction, especially in the context of therapeutic cancer vaccination. We discuss different cationic nanoparticulate vaccines, molecular mechanisms of adjuvanticity and biodistribution profiles upon administration via different routes. Finally, we discuss the perspectives of cationic nanoparticulate vaccines for improving immunotherapy of cancer.",0,"Cationic Nanoparticle-Based Cancer Vaccines Cationic nanoparticles have been shown to be surprisingly effective as cancer vaccine vehicles in preclinical and clinical studies.

Protocol for an ‘efficient design’ cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate a complex intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing for CHIldren presenting to primary care with acute COugh and respiratory tract infection: the CHICO study,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children are common and present major resource implications for primary care. Unnecessary use of antibiotics is associated with the development and proliferation of antimicrobial resistance. In 2016, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded ‘TARGET’ programme developed a prognostic algorithm to identify children with acute cough and RTI at very low risk of 30-day hospitalisation and unlikely to need antibiotics. The intervention includes: (1) explicit elicitation of parental concerns, (2) the results of the prognostic algorithm accompanied by prescribing guidance and (3) provision of a printout for carers including safety netting advice. The CHIldren’s COugh feasibility study suggested differential recruitment of healthier patients in control practices. This phase III ‘efficiently designed’ trial uses routinely collected data at the practice level, thus avoiding individual patient consent. The aim is to assess whether embedding a multifaceted intervention into general practitioner (GP) practice Information Technology (IT) systems will result in reductions of antibiotic prescribing without impacting on hospital attendance for RTI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The coprimary outcomes are (1) practice rate of dispensed amoxicillin and macrolide antibiotics, (2) hospital admission rate for RTI using routinely collected data by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Data will be collected for children aged 0–9 years registered at 310 practices (155 intervention, 155 usual care) over a 12-month period. Recruitment and randomisation of practices (using the Egton Medical Information Systems web data management system) is conducted via each CCG stratified for children registered and baseline dispensing rates of each practice. Secondary outcomes will explore intervention effect modifiers. Qualitative interviews will explore intervention usage. The economic evaluation will be limited to a between-arm comparison in a cost–consequence analysis.

Plasma mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with acute lung injury and mortality in septic patients,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a critical activator of inflammation. Circulating mtDNA released causes lung injury in experimental models. We hypothesized that elevated plasma mtDNA levels are associated with acute lung injury (ALI) in septic patients. METHODS: We enrolled 66 patients with sepsis admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2019 and October 2019. Respiratory, hemodynamic and bedside echocardiographic parameters were recorded. Plasma mtDNA, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 levels were examined. RESULTS: Plasma mtDNA levels within 24 h after admission were significantly increased in the group of septic patients with ALI [5.01 (3.38–6.64) vs 4.13 (3.20–5.07) log copies/µL, p 0.0172]. mtDNA levels were independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 3.2052; 95% CI 1.1608–8.8500; p 0.0253) and ALI risk (odds ratio 2.7506; 95% CI 1.1647–6.4959; p 0.0210). Patients with high mtDNA levels had worse outcomes, and post hoc tests showed significant differences in 28-day survival rates. Increased mtDNA levels were seen in patients with abdominal infection.

Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype,"The Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell (CRFK) is an immortalised cell line derived from the feline kidney that is utilised for the growth of certain vaccinal viruses. Confusion exists as to whether CRFK are epithelial or mesenchymal in phenotype. The aim of this study was to characterise CRFK cells via immunofluorescence, enzyme cytochemistry, western blotting, RT-qPCR for S100A4 and comparison to primary feline proximal tubular epithelial cells (FPTEC) and feline cortical fibroblasts (FCF). CRFK cells were of fusiform morphology and appeared similar to FCF. CRFK expressed the mesenchymal intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin together with two cell adhesion molecules associated with feline fibroblasts (CD29 and CD44), and lacked expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, myogenic IF desmin and endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF). In addition, CRFK did not demonstrate brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC. S100A4 gene expression, implicated in both neoplastic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, was highly upregulated in CRFK in comparison to the primary feline renal cells. CRFK appear phenotypically similar to fibroblasts, rather than tubular epithelial cells, and may have undergone neoplastic transformation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after extensive passaging. This finding may have potential implications for future research utilising this cell line.",0,"Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype The Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell (CRFK) is an immortalised cell line derived from the feline kidney that is utilised for the growth of certain vaccinal viruses.

‘Be on the TEAM’ Study (Teenagers Against Meningitis): protocol for a controlled clinical trial evaluating the impact of 4CMenB or MenB-fHbp vaccination on the pharyngeal carriage of meningococci in adolescents,"INTRODUCTION: Capsular group B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB) is the most common cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in many parts of the world. A MenB vaccine directed against the polysaccharide capsule remains elusive due to poor immunogenicity and safety concerns. The vaccines licensed for the prevention of MenB disease, 4CMenB (Bexsero) and MenB-fHbp (Trumenba), are serogroup B ‘substitute’ vaccines, comprised of subcapsular proteins and are designed to provide protection against most MenB disease-causing strains. In many high-income countries, such as the UK, adolescents are at increased risk of IMD and have the highest rates of meningococcal carriage. Beginning in the late 1990s, immunisation of this age group with the meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine reduced asymptomatic carriage and disrupted transmission of this organism, resulting in lower group C IMD incidence across all age groups. Whether vaccinating teenagers with the novel ‘MenB’ protein-based vaccines will prevent acquisition or reduce duration of carriage and generate herd protection was unknown at the time of vaccine introduction and could not be inferred from the effects of the conjugate vaccines. 4CMenB and MenB-fHbp may also impact on non-MenB disease-causing capsular groups as well as commensal Neisseria spp. This study will evaluate the impact of vaccination with 4CMenB or MenB-fHbp on oropharyngeal carriage of pathogenic meningococci in teenagers, and consequently the potential for these vaccines to provide broad community protection against MenB disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ‘Be on the TEAM’ (Teenagers Against Meningitis) Study is a pragmatic, partially randomised controlled trial of 24 000 students aged 16–19 years in their penultimate year of secondary school across the UK with regional allocation to a 0+6 month schedule of 4CMenB or MenB-fHbp or to a control group. Culture-confirmed oropharyngeal carriage will be assessed at baseline and at 12 months, following which the control group will be eligible for 4CMenB vaccination. The primary outcome is the carriage prevalence of potentially pathogenic meningococci (defined as those with genogroups B, C, W, Y or X), in each vaccine group compared separately to the control group at 12 months post-enrolment, that is, 12 months after the first vaccine dose and 6 months after the second vaccine dose. Secondary outcomes include impact on carriage of: genogroup B meningococci; hyperinvasive meningococci; all meningococci; those meningococci expressing vaccine antigens and; other Neisseria spp. A sample size of 8000 in each arm will provide 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in meningococcal carriage, assuming genogroup B, C, W, Y or X meningococci carriage of 3.43%, a design effect of 1.5, a retention rate of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. Study results will be available in 2021 and will inform the UK and international immunisation policy and future vaccine development. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the National Health Service South Central Research Ethics Committee (18/SC/0055); the UK Health Research Authority (IRAS ID 239091) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

Two Sides of a Coin: a Zika Virus Mutation Selected in Pregnant Rhesus Macaques Promotes Fetal Infection in Mice but at a Cost of Reduced Fitness in Nonpregnant Macaques and Diminished Transmissibility by Vectors,"Although fetal death is now understood to be a severe outcome of congenital Zika syndrome, the role of viral genetics is still unclear. We sequenced Zika virus (ZIKV) from a rhesus macaque fetus that died after inoculation and identified a single intrahost substitution, M1404I, in the ZIKV polyprotein, located in nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B). Targeted sequencing flanking position 1404 in 9 additional macaque mothers and their fetuses identified M1404I at a subconsensus frequency in the majority (5 of 9, 56%) of animals and some of their fetuses. Despite its repeated presence in pregnant macaques, M1404I has occurred rarely in humans since 2015. Since the primary ZIKV transmission cycle is human-mosquito-human, mutations in one host must be retained in the alternate host to be perpetuated. We hypothesized that ZIKV I1404 increases viral fitness in nonpregnant macaques and pregnant mice but is less efficiently transmitted by vectors, explaining its low frequency in humans during outbreaks. By examining competitive fitness relative to that of ZIKV M1404, we observed that ZIKV I1404 produced lower viremias in nonpregnant macaques and was a weaker competitor in tissues. In pregnant wild-type mice, ZIKV I1404 increased the magnitude and rate of placental infection and conferred fetal infection, in contrast to ZIKV M1404, which was not detected in fetuses. Although infection and dissemination rates were not different, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transmitted ZIKV I1404 more poorly than ZIKV M1404. Our data highlight the complexity of arbovirus mutation-fitness dynamics and suggest that intrahost ZIKV mutations capable of augmenting fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not necessarily spread efficiently via mosquitoes during epidemics. IMPORTANCE Although Zika virus infection of pregnant women can result in congenital Zika syndrome, the factors that cause the syndrome in some but not all infected mothers are still unclear. We identified a mutation that was present in some ZIKV genomes in experimentally inoculated pregnant rhesus macaques and their fetuses. Although we did not find an association between the presence of the mutation and fetal death, we performed additional studies with ZIKV with the mutation in nonpregnant macaques, pregnant mice, and mosquitoes. We observed that the mutation increased the ability of the virus to infect mouse fetuses but decreased its capacity to produce high levels of virus in the blood of nonpregnant macaques and to be transmitted by mosquitoes. This study shows that mutations in mosquito-borne viruses like ZIKV that increase fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not spread in outbreaks when they compromise transmission via mosquitoes and fitness in nonpregnant hosts.",0,"Two Sides of a Coin: a Zika Virus Mutation Selected in Pregnant Rhesus Macaques Promotes Fetal Infection in Mice but at a Cost of Reduced Fitness in Nonpregnant Macaques and Diminished Transmissibility by Vectors Although fetal death is now understood to be a severe outcome of congenital Zika syndrome, the role of viral genetics is still unclear.

Human immune responses to Plasmodium falciparum infection: molecular evidence for a suboptimal THαβ and TH17 bias over ideal and effective traditional TH1 immune response,"BACKGROUND: Using microarray analysis, this study showed up-regulation of toll-like receptors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, NF-κB, TNF, p38-MAPK, and MHC molecules in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following infection with Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: This analysis reports herein further studies based on time-course microarray analysis with focus on malaria-induced host immune response. RESULTS: The results show that in early malaria, selected immune response-related genes were up-regulated including α β and γ interferon-related genes, as well as genes of IL-15, CD36, chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, S100A8/9, CXCL9, and CXCL11), TRAIL and IgG Fc receptors. During acute febrile malaria, up-regulated genes included α β and γ interferon-related genes, IL-8, IL-1b IL-10 downstream genes, TGFB1, oncostatin-M, chemokines, IgG Fc receptors, ADCC signalling, complement-related genes, granzymes, NK cell killer/inhibitory receptors and Fas antigen. During recovery, genes for NK receptorsand granzymes/perforin were up-regulated. When viewed in terms of immune response type, malaria infection appeared to induce a mixed TH1 response, in which α and β interferon-driven responses appear to predominate over the more classic IL-12 driven pathway. In addition, TH17 pathway also appears to play a significant role in the immune response to P. falciparum. Gene markers of TH17 (neutrophil-related genes, TGFB1 and IL-6 family (oncostatin-M)) and THαβ (IFN-γ and NK cytotoxicity and ADCC gene) immune response were up-regulated. Initiation of THαβ immune response was associated with an IFN-αβ response, which ultimately resulted in moderate-mild IFN-γ achieved via a pathway different from the more classic IL-12 TH1 pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these observations, this study speculates that in P. falciparum infection, THαβ/TH17 immune response may predominate over ideal TH1 response.",0,"Human immune responses to Plasmodium falciparum infection: molecular evidence for a suboptimal THαβ and TH17 bias over ideal and effective traditional TH1 immune response BACKGROUND: Using microarray analysis, this study showed up-regulation of toll-like receptors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, NF-κB, TNF, p38-MAPK, and MHC molecules in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following infection with Plasmodium falciparum.

Functional Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum Surface-Related Antigen as a Potential Blood-Stage Vaccine Target,"Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion is a multistep process that involves a spectrum of interactions that are not well characterized. We have characterized a 113-kDa immunogenic protein, PF3D7_1431400 (PF14_0293), that possesses coiled-coil structures. The protein is localized on the surfaces of both merozoites and gametocytes, hence the name Plasmodium falciparum surface-related antigen (PfSRA). The processed 32-kDa fragment of PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes with different sensitivities to enzyme treatments. Temporal imaging from initial attachment to internalization of viable merozoites revealed that a fragment of PfSRA, along with PfMSP1(19,) is internalized after invasion. Moreover, parasite growth inhibition assays showed that PfSRA P1 antibodies potently inhibited erythrocyte invasion of both sialic acid–dependent and –independent parasite strains. Also, immunoepidemiological studies show that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA. Overall, the results demonstrate that PfSRA has the structural and functional characteristics of a very promising target for vaccine development.",0,"Functional Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum Surface-Related Antigen as a Potential Blood-Stage Vaccine Target Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion is a multistep process that involves a spectrum of interactions that are not well characterized.

A molecular cell atlas of the human lung from single cell RNA sequencing,"Although single cell RNA sequencing studies have begun providing compendia of cell expression profiles(1–9), it has proven more difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. Here we describe droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) applied to ~75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, which have allowed us to define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 of 45 previously known cell types or subtypes and 14 new ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas elucidates the biochemical functions of lung cell types and the cell-selective transcription factors and optimal markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signaling interactions including sources and targets of chemokines in immune cell trafficking and expression changes on lung homing; and identifies the cell types directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. Comparison to mouse identified 17 molecular types that appear to have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others whose expression profiles have been substantially altered, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types.

Meta-genomic analysis of toilet waste from long distance flights; a step towards global surveillance of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance,"Human populations worldwide are increasingly confronted with infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance spreading faster and appearing more frequently. Knowledge regarding their occurrence and worldwide transmission is important to control outbreaks and prevent epidemics. Here, we performed shotgun sequencing of toilet waste from 18 international airplanes arriving in Copenhagen, Denmark, from nine cities in three world regions. An average of 18.6 Gb (14.8 to 25.7 Gb) of raw Illumina paired end sequence data was generated, cleaned, trimmed and mapped against reference sequence databases for bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes. An average of 106,839 (0.06%) reads were assigned to resistance genes with genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, macrolide and beta-lactam resistance genes as the most abundant in all samples. We found significantly higher abundance and diversity of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, including critical important resistance (e.g. bla(CTX-M)) carried on airplanes from South Asia compared to North America. Presence of Salmonella enterica and norovirus were also detected in higher amounts from South Asia, whereas Clostridium difficile was most abundant in samples from North America. Our study provides a first step towards a potential novel strategy for global surveillance enabling simultaneous detection of multiple human health threatening genetic elements, infectious agents and resistance genes.",0,"Meta-genomic analysis of toilet waste from long distance flights; a step towards global surveillance of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance Human populations worldwide are increasingly confronted with infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance spreading faster and appearing more frequently.

"Impact of PBP2a Assay on Antibiotic Therapy of Patients with Non-Blood, Non-Urine Staphylococcus aureus Infections","BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests can reduce time to organism identification and susceptibility results, allowing for more rapid optimization of antibiotic therapy. We sought to determine whether a qualitative immunochromatographic assay (Alere™ PBP2a Culture Colony test) that differentiates methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) from methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) could optimize time to appropriate therapy for patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) and nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. aureus. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to The Johns Hopkins Hospital with a respiratory or wound culture growing S. aureus between July-October 2015 (baseline period) and July-October 2016 (intervention period) were included. The primary outcome was time to optimal antibiotic therapy from specimen collection before and after implementation of the PBP2a assay. Secondary outcomes were (1) time to antibiotic de-escalation from specimen collection, (2) length of hospital stay, and (3) number of vancomycin levels. An unadjusted analysis was conducted using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. RESULTS: 189 patients met eligibility criteria (119 baseline, 70 intervention). There were no significant differences in characteristics of patients between periods. Overall time to optimal therapy decreased during the intervention period compared with baseline (IQR 0–24.7 hours vs. 0–64.2 hours, P = 0.02). In the subset of patients with SSTIs, time to optimal and de-escalation of antibiotic therapy was reduced during the intervention period compared with baseline (IQR 0–6.6 vs. 0-70.8, P = 0.02 and IQR 0–26.5 vs. 0-65.5, P = 0.05, respectively), but not with pneumonia. Length of hospital stay (median 6 days in each, P = 0.60) and number of vancomycin levels (median 0 vs. 1, P = 0.33) were similar before and after assay implementation. CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in time to optimal antibiotic therapy after implementation of the PBP2a assay driven by changes in SSTI regimens but not pneumonia regimens. Incorporation of a rapid test to differentiate MSSA from MRSA be a useful addition to antibiotic stewardship initiatives to optimize therapy for patients with MSSA infection. DISCLOSURES: P.

Alternative Polyadenylation of Human Bocavirus at Its 3′ End Is Regulated by Multiple Elements and Affects Capsid Expression,"Alternative processing of human bocavirus (HBoV) P5 promoter-transcribed RNA is critical for generating the structural and nonstructural protein-encoding mRNA transcripts. The regulatory mechanism by which HBoV RNA transcripts are polyadenylated at proximal [(pA)p] or distal [(pA)d] polyadenylation sites is still unclear. We constructed a recombinant HBoV infectious clone to study the alternative polyadenylation regulation of HBoV. Surprisingly, in addition to the reported distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, a novel distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, which is located in the right-end hairpin (REH), was identified during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. (pA)d2 does not contain typical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal, upstream elements (USE), or downstream elements (DSE) according to sequence analysis. Further study showed that HBoV nonstructural protein NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d were necessary and sufficient for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. The distance and sequences between (pA)d and (pA)d2 also played a key role in the regulation of polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Finally, we demonstrated that efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2 resulted in increased HBoV capsid mRNA transcripts and protein translation. Thus, our study revealed that all the bocaviruses have distal poly(A) signals on the right-end palindromic terminus, and alternative polyadenylation at the HBoV 3′ end regulates its capsid expression. IMPORTANCE The distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, of HBoV is located about 400 nucleotides (nt) from the right-end palindromic terminus, which is different from those of bovine parvovirus (BPV) and canine minute virus (MVC) in the same genus whose distal polyadenylation is located in the right-end stem-loop structure. A novel polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, was identified in the right-end hairpin of HBoV during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. Sequence analysis showed that (pA)d2 does not contain typical polyadenylation signals, and the last 42 nt form a stem-loop structure which is almost identical to that of MVC. Further study showed that NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 enhances capsid expression. Our study demonstrates alternative polyadenylation at the 3′ end of HBoV and suggests an additional mechanism by which capsid expression is regulated.",0,"Alternative Polyadenylation of Human Bocavirus at Its 3′ End Is Regulated by Multiple Elements and Affects Capsid Expression Alternative processing of human bocavirus (HBoV) P5 promoter-transcribed RNA is critical for generating the structural and nonstructural protein-encoding mRNA transcripts.

The Influenza Virus Protein PB1-F2 Increases Viral Pathogenesis through Neutrophil Recruitment and NK Cells Inhibition,"The influenza A virus (IAV) PB1-F2 protein is a virulence factor contributing to the pathogenesis observed during IAV infections in mammals. In this study, using a mouse model, we compared the host response associated with PB1-F2 with an early transcriptomic signature that was previously associated with neutrophils and consecutively fatal IAV infections. This allowed us to show that PB1-F2 is partly involved in neutrophil-related mechanisms leading to death. Using neutropenic mice, we confirmed that the harmful effect of PB1-F2 is due to an excessive inflammation mediated by an increased neutrophil mobilization. We identified the downstream effects of this PB1-F2-exacerbated neutrophil recruitment. PB1-F2 had no impact on the lymphocyte recruitment in the airways at day 8 pi. However, functional genomics analysis and flow cytometry in broncho-alveolar lavages at 4 days pi revealed that PB1-F2 induced a NK cells deficiency. Thus, our results identify PB1-F2 as an important immune disruptive factor during the IAV infection.",0,"The Influenza Virus Protein PB1-F2 Increases Viral Pathogenesis through Neutrophil Recruitment and NK Cells Inhibition The influenza A virus (IAV) PB1-F2 protein is a virulence factor contributing to the pathogenesis observed during IAV infections in mammals.

Tumor regression and immunity in combination therapy with anti-CEA chimeric antigen receptor T cells and anti-CEA-IL2 immunocytokine,"Targeted immunotherapy of solid cancers with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and immunocytokines are attractive options in that they both rely on the specificity of tumor-targeted antibodies. Since carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression in both colon and breast cancers is correlated with poor prognosis, it was chosen as a model tumor target in immunocompetent CEA transgenic (CEATg) mice. A second-generation anti-CEA CAR derived from CEA-specific antibody T84.66 was used to treat murine MC38 colon or E0771 breast carcinomas transfected with CEA. Anti-CEA CAR vs. mock transduced T cells exhibited a CEA-specific cytotoxic and IFN[Image: see text] dose response to both CEA transfected cell lines vs. their CEA-negative controls. Anti-CEA CAR vs. mock transduced T cells delayed the median survival of CEA transfected s.c. MC38 or orthotopic E0771 tumor-bearing CEATg mice by 2 days. With the addition of one-day prior cyclophosphamide (CY) lymphodepletion, anti-CEA CAR T cell treatment delayed the median survival of MC38/CEA and E0771/CEA tumor-bearing CEATg mice by ten and 3 days, respectively. Since CAR T cells require IL2 for survival and expansion, anti-CEA-IL2 immunocytokine (ICK) treatment was performed post CAR T cell therapy. Single ICK treatment 1 day after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy in the MC38/CEA model, and two ICK treatments every 3 days after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy in the E0771/CEA model were ineffective, while four ICK treatments every 3 days after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy completely eradicated MC38/CEA tumor growth and induced tumor immunity when the mice were re-challenged with tumor. These studies show the therapeutic potential of anti-CEA CAR T cells combined with ICK to treat CEA-positive tumors.

"Utility of primary cells to examine NPC1 receptor expression in Mops condylurus, a potential Ebola virus reservoir","The significance of the integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) in the ebolavirus entry process has been determined using various cell lines derived from humans, non-human primates and fruit bats. Fruit bats have long been purported as the potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses, however several studies provide evidence that Mops condylurus, an insectivorous microbat, is also an ebolavirus reservoir. NPC1 receptor expression in the context of ebolavirus replication in microbat cells remains unstudied. In order to study Ebola virus (EBOV) cellular entry and replication in M. condylurus, we derived primary and immortalized cell cultures from 12 different organs. The NPC1 receptor expression was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry comparing the expression levels of M. condylurus primary and immortalized cells, HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney cells and cells from a European microbat species. EBOV replication kinetics was studied for four representative cell cultures using qRT-PCR. The aim was to elucidate the suitability of primary and immortalized cells from different tissues for studying NPC1 receptor expression levels and their potential influence on EBOV replication. The NPC1 receptor expression level in M. condylurus primary cells differed depending on the organ they were derived from and was for most cell types significantly lower than in human cell lines. Immortalized cells showed for most cell types higher expression levels than their corresponding primary cells. Concluding from our infection experiments with EBOV we suggest a potential correlation between NPC1 receptor expression level and virus replication rate in vitro.",0,"Utility of primary cells to examine NPC1 receptor expression in Mops condylurus, a potential Ebola virus reservoir The significance of the integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) in the ebolavirus entry process has been determined using various cell lines derived from humans, non-human primates and fruit bats.

Frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in horses recently imported to the United States,"BACKGROUND: Imported horses that have undergone recent long distance transport might represent a serious risk for spreading infectious respiratory pathogens into populations of horses. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in recently imported horses. ANIMALS: All imported horses with signed owner consent (n = 167) entering a USDA quarantine for contagious equine metritis from October 2014 to June 2016 were enrolled in the study. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Enrolled horses had a physical examination performed and nasal secretions collected at the time of entry and subsequently if any horse developed signs of respiratory disease during quarantine. Samples were assayed for equine influenza virus (EIV), equine herpesvirus type‐1, −2, −4, and −5 (EHV‐1, −2, −4, −5), equine rhinitis virus A (ERAV), and B (ERBV) and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Equine herpesviruses were detected by qPCR in 52% of the study horses including EHV‐2 (28.7%), EHV‐5 (40.7%), EHV‐1 (1.2%), and EHV‐4 (3.0%). Clinical signs were not correlated with being qPCR‐positive for EHV‐4, EHV‐2, or EHV‐5. None of the samples were qPCR‐positive for EIV, ERAV, ERBV, and S. equi. The qPCR assay failed quality control for RNA viruses in 25% (46/167) of samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Clinical signs of respiratory disease were poorly correlated with qPCR positive status for EHV‐2, −4, and −5. The importance of γ‐herpesviruses (EHV‐2 and 5) in respiratory disease is poorly understood. Equine herpesvirus type‐1 or 4 (EHV‐1 or EHV‐4) were detected in 4.2% of horses, which could have serious consequences if shedding animals entered a population of susceptible horses. Biosecurity measures are important when introducing recently imported horses into resident US populations of horses.",0,"Frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in horses recently imported to the United States BACKGROUND: Imported horses that have undergone recent long distance transport might represent a serious risk for spreading infectious respiratory pathogens into populations of horses.

Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Eravacycline in Subjects with Renal or Hepatic Impairment Compared with Healthy Subjects,"BACKGROUND: Eravacycline (ERV) is a fluorocycline being developed for the treatment of serious infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. The PK of ERV in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) or hepatic impairment (HI) were investigated. METHODS: Two multi-center studies were completed; one in subjects with ESRD and one in subjects with mild, moderate or severe HI based upon Child-Pugh scoring. Each included a cohort of healthy subjects (HS) matched by gender, age and BMI. A single IV dose of 1.5 mg/kg ERV was administered. PK parameters were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods and within study comparisons of PK for the ESRD and HI subjects were made with HS. RESULTS: The following comparative AUC(inf) and C(max) values for ERV were observed: CONCLUSION: Following a single IV dose of ERV, the systemic exposures in subjects with ESRD and mild or moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those observed in HS. The 2-fold increase in AUC(inf) observed in subjects with severe HI did not result in increased adverse events. Therefore, no dose adjustment should be required when ERV is given to subjects with either renal or hepatic impairment.

Specific Integration of Temperate Phage Decreases the Pathogenicity of Host Bacteria,"Temperate phages are considered as natural vectors for gene transmission among bacteria due to the ability to integrate their genomes into a host chromosome, therefore, affect the fitness and phenotype of host bacteria. Many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in temperate phage genomes, supporting the concept that temperate phages play important roles in increasing the bacterial pathogenicity through delivery of the virulence genes. However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence. Here, we report a novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage, vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09), which has a 42,129-bp dsDNA genome with a G+C content of 62.8%. Phylogenetic analysis based on large terminase subunit indicated that phage PHB09 represented a new member of the family Siphoviridae. The genome of PHB09 contains genes encoding lysogen-associated proteins, including integrase and cI protein. The integration site of PHB09 is specifically located within a pilin gene of B. bronchiseptica. Importantly, we found that the integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice, most likely through disruption the expression of pilin gene. Moreover, a single shot of the prophage bearing B. bronchiseptica strain completely protected mice against lethal challenge with wild-type virulent B. bronchiseptica, indicating the vaccine potential of lysogenized strain. Our findings not only indicate the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than simple delivery of virulent genes but also provide a potential strategy for developing bacterial vaccines.",0,"Specific Integration of Temperate Phage Decreases the Pathogenicity of Host Bacteria Temperate phages are considered as natural vectors for gene transmission among bacteria due to the ability to integrate their genomes into a host chromosome, therefore, affect the fitness and phenotype of host bacteria. Many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in temperate phage genomes, supporting the concept that temperate phages play important roles in increasing the bacterial pathogenicity through delivery of the virulence genes. However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence. Here, we report a novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage, vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09), which has a 42,129-bp dsDNA genome with a G+C content of 62.8%. Phylogenetic analysis based on large terminase subunit indicated that phage PHB09 represented a new member of the family Siphoviridae. The genome of PHB09 contains genes encoding lysogen-associated proteins, including integrase and cI protein. The integration site of PHB09 is specifically located within a pilin gene of B. bronchiseptica. Importantly, we found that the integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice, most likely through disruption the expression of pilin gene.

Abdominal Muscle Activity during Mechanical Ventilation Increases Lung Injury in Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: It has proved that muscle paralysis was more protective for injured lung in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the precise mechanism is not clear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation increases lung injury in severe ARDS. METHODS: Eighteen male Beagles were studied under mechanical ventilation with anesthesia. Severe ARDS was induced by repetitive oleic acid infusion. After lung injury, Beagles were randomly assigned into spontaneous breathing group (BIPAP(SB)) and abdominal muscle paralysis group (BIPAP(AP)). All groups were ventilated with BIPAP model for 8h, and the high pressure titrated to reached a tidal volume of 6ml/kg, the low pressure was set at 10 cmH(2)O, with I:E ratio 1:1, and respiratory rate adjusted to a PaCO(2) of 35–60 mmHg. Six Beagles without ventilator support comprised the control group. Respiratory variables, end-expiratory volume (EELV) and gas exchange were assessed during mechanical ventilation. The levels of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 in lung tissue and plasma were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Lung injury scores were determined at end of the experiment. RESULTS: For the comparable ventilator setting, as compared with BIPAP(SB) group, the BIPAP(AP) group presented higher EELV (427±47 vs. 366±38 ml) and oxygenation index (293±36 vs. 226±31 mmHg), lower levels of IL-6(216.6±48.0 vs. 297.5±71.2 pg/ml) and IL-8(246.8±78.2 vs. 357.5±69.3 pg/ml) in plasma, and lower express levels of IL-6 mRNA (15.0±3.8 vs. 21.2±3.7) and IL-8 mRNA (18.9±6.8 vs. 29.5±7.9) in lung tissues. In addition, less lung histopathology injury were revealed in the BIPAP(AP) group (22.5±2.0 vs. 25.2±2.1). CONCLUSION: Abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation is one of the injurious factors in severe ARDS, so abdominal muscle paralysis might be an effective strategy to minimize ventilator-induce lung injury.",0,"Abdominal Muscle Activity during Mechanical Ventilation Increases Lung Injury in Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome OBJECTIVE: It has proved that muscle paralysis was more protective for injured lung in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the precise mechanism is not clear.

"Comparison of Respiratory Pathogen Detections from Routine Hospital Testing and Expanded Systematic Testing from the Minnesota Severe Acute Respiratory Illness Surveillance Program, 2015–2016","BACKGROUND: Hospital testing for respiratory pathogens is nonsystematic, leading to potential missed detection of clinically relevant pathogens. The Minnesota Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance program monitors hospitalizations due to acute respiratory illness and conducts systematic testing for several respiratory pathogens. We assessed viruses detected by the hospital and additional detections identified by expanded testing. METHODS: Residual upper respiratory specimens collected from patients hospitalized for suspected respiratory illness for routine diagnostic testing at three hospitals, including one children’s hospital, were submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). Specimens were tested for 18 respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. Clinical and hospital test data were collected through medical record review. RESULTS: From September 2015 to August 2016, 2,351 hospitalized SARI patients were reported, with the following age distribution: 57% <5 years, 13% 5–17 years, 30% ≥18 years. Among all SARI patients, 97% (2,273) had hospital-based, clinician-directed testing for viral pathogens. Viruses were detected among 47% (1,077) of tested patients, among which testing methods included PCR (85%), rapid antigen (13%), and culture (2%); 74% were tested on the day of admission. Most common viruses detected by clinical testing included respiratory syncytial virus (41%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (31%), and influenza (15%) (Figure 1). Systematic RT–PCR testing at MDH identified 1,600 (68%) patients positive for ≥1 respiratory virus, identifying previously unknown detections among 35% (820) of SARI patients (Figure 2). Of 1,272 patients with no virus identified at the hospital, 46% (586) had a viral detection at MDH. Patients aged <18 years were significantly more likely to have an additional pathogen detected by MDH testing than those aged ≥18 years (P < 0.01), including rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: Systematic, expanded testing at MDH identified a higher proportion of respiratory pathogens among SARI patients compared with clinical laboratory testing. Additional testing for clinically relevant respiratory pathogens may inform medical decision-making.

"Promoting HIV, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus Screening Among Migrants With a Language Barrier: Protocol for the Development and Evaluation of an Electronic App (Apidé)","BACKGROUND: Late diagnoses of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are important public health problems that affect the population at large and migrants in particular. Missed opportunities of HIV and hepatitis screening are numerous, with language differences being a significant barrier to testing. Several studies have shown that migrants who do not speak the language of the health provider are less likely to get tested, due to health providers’ reluctance to offer a test and to migrants’ reluctance to accept testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to develop a multilingual electronic tool (app) that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and to evaluate its acceptability and impact in terms of public health. METHODS: The study will go through 3 stages: (1) concept development, (2) app development, and (3) app evaluation. A qualitative study has been undertaken to explore language barriers during health care encounters and their effect on communication, specifically when a screening test is offered. In parallel, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to have a comprehensive overlook of electronic tools designed to help health care providers communicate with migrants with a language barrier. To generate a list of items to be translated for inclusion in the app, we will conduct a focus group and Delphi survey. The development of the app will include translation and voice recording of items. The electronic development will also include 3 steps of user testing. The acceptability of the app will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale. Evaluation of the app’s efficacy will consist of a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. The study will be carried out in 16 centers that treat migrants and offer them screening tests for infectious diseases. The primary outcome is the percentage of screening tests realized. The secondary outcomes are the rate of screening proposal by health professionals, acceptance rate by migrants, number of positive cases using this app, and frequency of use of the app. RESULTS: The app evaluation study received a 3-year grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche contre le SIDA et les hépatites virales (ANRS) and from the Office Français de l’Immigration et Intégration (OFII). At the time of publication of this protocol, the initial qualitative study and systematic literature review were completed. CONCLUSIONS: This study will develop an app that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and measure its acceptability and effectiveness in terms of public health. When completed, this app could be distributed to numerous professionals carrying out screening with migrant populations in various health care settings.

Individual plasmacytoid dendritic cells are major contributors to the production of multiple innate cytokines in an organ-specific manner during viral infection,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are an important source of IFN-α/β in response to a variety of viruses in vivo, including murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). However, the respective contributions of various infected organs, and within these of pDCs, conventional dendritic cells and other cells, to the systemic production of IFN-α/β or other innate cytokines during viral infections in vivo is largely unknown. Whether a specialization of pDC subsets in the production of different patterns of innate cytokines exists in vivo in response to a viral infection has not been investigated. Here, by analyzing for the first time directly ex vivo, at the single-cell level, the simultaneous production of up to three cytokines in pDCs isolated from MCMV-infected mice, we show that (i) pDCs are the quasi-exclusive source of IFN-α/β, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, early during MCMV infection, in two immunocompetent mouse lines and with two viral strains, (ii) pDC activation for IFN-α/β production is organ specific and (iii) a significant proportion of pDCs simultaneously produce IFN-α/β, TNF-α and IL-12, although TNF-α and IFN-α/β appear more often co-expressed with one another than each of them with IL-12. Altogether, these results show a broad and non-redundant role of pDCs in early innate detection of, and defense against, viral infection. The data also show differences in the responsiveness of pDCs from different tissues and suggest distinct molecular requirements for pDC production of various cytokines. These observations must be taken into account when designing new antiviral vaccination strategies aimed at harnessing pDC responses.",0,"Individual plasmacytoid dendritic cells are major contributors to the production of multiple innate cytokines in an organ-specific manner during viral infection Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are an important source of IFN-α/β in response to a variety of viruses in vivo, including murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV).

Evaluation of Mucosal and Systemic Immune Responses Elicited by GPI-0100- Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine Delivered by Different Immunization Strategies,"Vaccines for protection against respiratory infections should optimally induce a mucosal immune response in the respiratory tract in addition to a systemic immune response. However, current parenteral immunization modalities generally fail to induce mucosal immunity, while mucosal vaccine delivery often results in poor systemic immunity. In order to find an immunization strategy which satisfies the need for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity, we compared local and systemic immune responses elicited by two mucosal immunizations, given either by the intranasal (IN) or the intrapulmonary (IPL) route, with responses elicited by a mucosal prime followed by a systemic boost immunization. The study was conducted in BALB/c mice and the vaccine formulation was an influenza subunit vaccine supplemented with GPI-0100, a saponin-derived adjuvant. While optimal mucosal antibody titers were obtained after two intrapulmonary vaccinations, optimal systemic antibody responses were achieved by intranasal prime followed by intramuscular boost. The latter strategy also resulted in the best T cell response, yet, it was ineffective in inducing nose or lung IgA. Successful induction of secretory IgA, IgG and T cell responses was only achieved with prime-boost strategies involving intrapulmonary immunization and was optimal when both immunizations were given via the intrapulmonary route. Our results underline that immunization via the lungs is particularly effective for priming as well as boosting of local and systemic immune responses.",0,"Evaluation of Mucosal and Systemic Immune Responses Elicited by GPI-0100- Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine Delivered by Different Immunization Strategies Vaccines for protection against respiratory infections should optimally induce a mucosal immune response in the respiratory tract in addition to a systemic immune response.

Alginic Acid-Coated Chitosan Nanoparticles Loaded with Legumain DNA Vaccine: Effect against Breast Cancer in Mice,"Legumain-based DNA vaccines have potential to protect against breast cancer. However, the lack of a safe and efficient oral delivery system restricts its clinical application. Here, we constructed alginic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles (A.C.NPs) as an oral delivery carrier for a legumain DNA vaccine. First, we tested its characteristic in acidic environments in vitro. DNA agarose electrophoresis data show that A.C.NPs protected DNA better from degradation in acidic solution (pH 1.5) than did chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs). Furthermore, size distribution analysis showed that A.C.NPs tended to aggregate and form micrometer scale complexes in pH<2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH. Mice were intragastrically administrated A.C.NPs carrying EGFP plasmids and EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal Peyer’s patches. Full-length legumain plasmids were loaded into different delivery carriers, including C.NPs, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and A.C.NPs. A.C.NPs loaded with empty plasmids served as a control.

However, the lack of a safe and efficient oral delivery system restricts its clinical application. Here, we constructed alginic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles (A.C.NPs) as an oral delivery carrier for a legumain DNA vaccine. First, we tested its characteristic in acidic environments in vitro. DNA agarose electrophoresis data show that A.C.NPs protected DNA better from degradation in acidic solution (pH 1.5) than did chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs). Furthermore, size distribution analysis showed that A.C.NPs tended to aggregate and form micrometer scale complexes in pH<2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH. Mice were intragastrically administrated A.C.NPs carrying EGFP plasmids and EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal Peyer’s patches. Full-length legumain plasmids were loaded into different delivery carriers, including C.NPs, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and A.C.NPs. A.C.NPs loaded with empty plasmids served as a control.

Use of Oral Ribavirin for the Treatment of RSV Infections in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) Recipients,"BACKGROUND: The benefit of aerosolized ribavirin (AR) in reducing the risk of progression of RSV infections and RSV-associated mortality in HCT recipients has been recognized, yet there is a paucity of data assessing the use of oral ribavirin (OR) in this patient population. We evaluated outcomes associated with the use of OR compared with AR in HCT recipients. METHODS: Retrospective review of all HCT recipients with RSV infection treated with OR or AR during three RSV seasons (September 2014 – February 2017). An established immunodeficiency Scoring Index (ISI) was applied to identify patients at high risk for progression and death based on host risk factors. Mortality, progression to lower respiratory infection (LRI), and need for ICU admission was compared among recipients of AR and OR. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were treated with OR (n = 42, 39%) or AR (n = 65, 61%). Recipients of AR and OR were equally likely to be high-risk by ISI scoring (11% vs. 10%, P = 1.00). Fifty-three patients (50%) presented with upper respiratory infection (URI) of whom 13 (25%) progressed to LRI. There was no difference in the rate of progression to LRI between patients who received AR and OR (28% vs. 19%, P = 0.53). No difference was found in 30-day mortality rates based on treatment strategy (8% AR vs. 5% OR, P = 0.70). Interestingly, 90-day mortality was found to be significantly lower among patients who received OR vs. AR (20% vs. 5%, P = 0.04). No differences in rates of ICU admission and requirement for mechanical ventilation were found between the two groups. For the 99 inpatients at time of diagnosis, median (interquartile range) length of stay was 7 (5 – 19) days, and was similar for patients on either treatment modality. Eight patients were treated for RSV on an outpatient basis and all received OR. CONCLUSION: HCT patients with RSV had similar outcomes when treated with AR and OR. OR may be a safe and effective alternative to AR for prevention and treatment of RSV in HCT patients with significantly reduced cost. DISCLOSURES: R.

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) in Canadian Children: A National Surveillance Study,"PURPOSE: Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) is universally fatal unless treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Following the identification of disseminated Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infections in Canadian First Nations, Métis and Inuit (FNMI) children with unrecognized primary immune deficiencies, a national surveillance study was initiated in order to determine the incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of children with SCID in Canada. METHODS: Canadian pediatricians were asked to complete a monthly reporting form if they had seen a suspected SCID case, from 2004 to 2010, through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). If the case met CPSP SCID criteria, more detailed data, including demographics and clinical information about investigations, treatment and outcome was collected. RESULTS: A total of 40 cases of SCID were confirmed for an estimated incidence of SCID in non-FNMI Canadian children of 1.4 per 100,000 live births (95 % CI 1 to 1.9/100,000). The proportion of SCID cases that were FNMI (17.5 %) was almost three times higher than was expected on the basis of proportion of the pediatric population estimated to be FNMI (6.3 %) resulting in an estimated incidence of 4.4 per 100,000 live births (95 % CI 2.1 to 9.2/100,000) in FNMI Canadian children. The mean age at diagnosis for all SCID cases was 4.2 months (range 1–583 days). There were 12 deaths (30 %; 95 % CI 18–46 %); seven died of confirmed or suspected infections before they could receive an HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCID cases in FNMI children is higher than in the general Canadian pediatric population. The high mortality rate, due primarily to infection, suggests that early diagnosis by newborn screening followed by HSCT could significantly benefit children with SCID.",0,"Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) in Canadian Children: A National Surveillance Study PURPOSE: Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) is universally fatal unless treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

How I See Me—A Meta-Analysis Investigating the Association Between Identities and Pro-environmental Behaviour,"Prolific research suggests identity associates with pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs) that are individual and/or group focused. Individual PEB is personally driven, self-reliant, and are conducted on one's own (e.g., home recycling). Group focused PEB is other people-reliant and completed as part of a group (e.g., attending meetings of an environmental organisation). A wide range of identities have been related to PEBs. For example, a recent systematic qualitative review revealed 99 different types of identities studied in a PEB context. Most studies were correlational, few had an experimental design. However, the relationships between all these identities and PEBs have so far not been tested quantitatively with meta-analytical techniques. As such, a clear overview of this field is currently lacking. Due to the diverse nature of the field, a priori hypotheses were not possible and relatively broad definitions of identity had to be used to encompass all types of identities and the diverse meanings of identity that have been included in PEB research. What prior theory did allow for was to assess the distinction between two main types of identity, namely how people label, describe, and recognise oneself individually (individual identity), or as part of a group (group identity). Our overall goal was thus to assess the current state of knowledge on identities and PEBs. In 104 studies using a meta-regression following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, our random-effects meta-analysis showed that the overall concept of identity associated with PEB with a medium Pearson's r (Aim 1). Furthermore, we found that individual identities associated more strongly with PEBs than group identities (Aim 2). The associations between individual and group identities were stronger when the identity and PEB were from the same category (e.g., when both were group-focused; Aim 3). Methodologically, the findings revealed that group identities and group PEBs were most strongly associated for self-reported rather than observed PEBs (Aim 4). Overall identity associated most strongly with group PEBs in the field rather than in the lab (Aim 5) and in student- rather than non-student samples (Aim 6).

A Human Monoclonal Antibody against Hepatitis B Surface Antigen with Potent Neutralizing Activity,"We describe the production and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for the major hepatitis B virus (HBV) S protein. The mAbs, two IgG1κ and one IgG1λ, were secreted by B-cell clones obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of one person convalescent from acute hepatitis B and one vaccinated individual. The former recognized a denaturation-insensitive epitope within the p24 protein whereas the latter recognized a denaturation-sensitive, conformational epitope located within the HBsAg common “a” determinant. This mAb, denominated ADRI-2F3, displayed a very high protective titer of over 43,000 IU/mg mAb and showed an extremely potent neutralizing activity in the in vitro model of HBV infection using primary hepatocytes from Tupaia belangeri as target. Recombinant variable heavy and light domain sequences derived from mAb ADRI-2F3 were cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors and showed identical fine specificity and 1 log(10) higher titer than the original IgG1λ. It is envisaged that such mAb will be able to efficiently prevent HBV reinfection after liver transplantation for end-stage chronic HBV infection or infection after needle-stick exposure, providing an unlimited source of valuable protective anti-HBs antibody.",0,"A Human Monoclonal Antibody against Hepatitis B Surface Antigen with Potent Neutralizing Activity We describe the production and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for the major hepatitis B virus (HBV) S protein.

Exhaled nitric oxide and pulmonary complications after paediatric stem cell transplantation,"Pulmonary complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We hypothesise that elevated exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels early after HSCT in children are predictive for pulmonary complications. The present prospective study included 30 children (age, 4–18 years) before HSCT. FeNO levels were evaluated 10 days before transplant, at day 0, day +28 and day +60 after HSCT. During the follow-up period until day +100, pulmonary complications and lung function were assessed. Before HSCT, the mean FeNO levels were comparable in children with or without post-transplant pulmonary complications. However, they differed at day 0 and day +28 with a mean of 7 (±1.95) and 13 (±3.44) ppb at day 0 and a mean of 13 (±3.44) and 14 (±3.57) ppb at day +28, respectively. Conclusion: Children with pulmonary complications after day +28 have higher mean FeNO levels 28 days after HSCT than children without later pulmonary complications. Therefore, FeNO could be an important diagnostic tool for hyperinflammatory response in bronchial epithelium after paediatric HSCT.",0,"Exhaled nitric oxide and pulmonary complications after paediatric stem cell transplantation Pulmonary complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Therefore, FeNO could be an important diagnostic tool for hyperinflammatory response in bronchial epithelium after paediatric HSCT.",exhaled nitric oxide and pulmonary complications after paediatric stem cell transplantation pulmonary complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct we hypothesise that elevated exhaled nitric oxide feno levels early after hsct in children are predictive for pulmonary complications the present prospective study included 30 children age 418 years before hsct feno levels were evaluated 10 days before transplant at day 0 day 28 and day 60 after hsct during the followup period until day 100 pulmonary complications and lung function were assessed before hsct the mean feno levels were comparable in children with or without posttransplant pulmonary complications however they differed at day 0 and day 28 with a mean of 7 195 and 13 344 ppb at day 0 and a mean of 13 344 and 14 357 ppb at day 28 respectively conclusion children with pulmonary complications after day 28 have higher mean feno levels 28 days after hsct than children without later pulmonary complications therefore feno could be an important diagnostic tool for hyperinflammatory response in bronchial epithelium after paediatric hsct,1
Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following respiratory syncytial virus infection,"Despite being a leading cause of severe respiratory disease, there remains no licensed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease, but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection. In contrast, the role of memory CD8 T cells in protecting against a secondary RSV infection is less established. We recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following RSV infection, but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by IFN-γ. To evaluate the ability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology, mice with high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to RSV challenge. Neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following RSV challenge compared with IgG-treated controls. Neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication, which caused a substantial reduction in memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-γ production, directly resulting in survival. In contrast, therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity, mortality, or IFN-γ levels, despite significantly reducing lung viral titers. Therefore, only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection. Overall, our results have important implications for the development of future RSV vaccines.",0,"Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following respiratory syncytial virus infection Despite being a leading cause of severe respiratory disease, there remains no licensed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.

Total OH Reactivity of Emissions from Humans: In Situ Measurement and Budget Analysis,"[Image: see text] Humans are a potent, mobile source of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor environments. Such direct anthropogenic emissions are gaining importance, as those from furnishings and building materials have become better regulated and energy efficient homes may reduce ventilation. While previous studies have characterized human emissions in indoor environments, the question remains whether VOCs remain unidentified by current measuring techniques. In this study conducted in a climate chamber occupied by four people, the total OH reactivity of air was quantified, together with multiple VOCs measured by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) and fast gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (fast-GC–MS). Whole-body, breath, and dermal emissions were assessed. The comparison of directly measured OH reactivity and that of the summed reactivity of individually measured species revealed no significant shortfall. Ozone exposure (37 ppb) was found to have little influence on breath OH reactivity but enhanced dermal OH reactivity significantly. Without ozone, the whole-body OH reactivity was dominated by breath emissions, mostly isoprene (76%). With ozone present, OH reactivity nearly doubled, with the increase being mainly caused by dermal emissions of mostly carbonyl compounds (57%). No significant difference in total OH reactivity was observed for different age groups (teenagers/young adults/seniors) without ozone. With ozone present, the total OH reactivity decreased slightly with increasing age.",0,"Total OH Reactivity of Emissions from Humans: In Situ Measurement and Budget Analysis [Image: see text] Humans are a potent, mobile source of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor environments.

Cushing’s syndrome complicated by multiple opportunistic infections,"The case history of a 56-year-old man is described who suffered from severe adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. The clinical course was complicated by simultaneous infections with Pneumocystis carinii, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Herpes simplex, which proved to be fatal. A study of the literature shows that opportunistic infections in endogenous Cushing’s syndrome are associated with severe cortisol excess and carry a high mortality. Opportunistic infections are most prevalent in the ectopic ACTH syndrome, explained by the very high plasma cortisol concentrations in this condition. Infections with Aspergillus species, Cryptoccus neoformans, Pneumocystis carinii and Nocardia asteroides predominated. Cushing’s syndrome with a very high plasma cortisol concentration causes a severe immunocompromized state. Prompt evaluation of the cause of the hypercortisolism, initiation of cortisol lowering therapy, primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection when plasma cortisol exceeds 2500 nmol L(−1) and a search for concomitant infectious disease is recommended.",0,"Cushing’s syndrome complicated by multiple opportunistic infections The case history of a 56-year-old man is described who suffered from severe adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing’s syndrome.

Comparison Of Four Anti-Avian IgY Secondary Antibodies Used In Western Blot And Dot-Blot ELISA To Detect Avian Bornavirus Antibodies In Four Different Bird Species,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the specificity of different avian secondary antibodies used in Western blot and dot-blot ELISA to detect avian bornavirus antibodies in bird plasma. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from: two Blue and gold macaws, one positive and one negative for avian bornavirus by RT-PCR; a Cockatiel and a Monk parakeet prior to and following experimental infection; and, two Mallards, one positive and one negative for avian bornavirus by RT-PCR Samples were analyzed by Western blot and dot-blot ELISA that incorporated recombinant avian bornavirus nucleoprotein as the target analyte. Four species-specific anti-IgY secondary antibodies were used in the assays: goat anti-macaw IgY, goat anti-bird IgY, goat anti-duck IgY, and rabbit anti-chicken IgY. RESULTS: In the Western blot, anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw and Cockatiel positive plasma, but no signal with Mallard positive plasma. Anti-bird IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw, Cockatiel, and Mallard positive plasma. Anti-duck and anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody produced a strong and moderate signal, respectively, only with Mallard positive plasma. In the dot-blot ELISA, there was a distinct and significant difference (P<0.05) in the signal intensity between the different secondary antibodies within a bird species. Anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody produced significantly (P<0.05) stronger signals than the other secondary antibodies in Blue and gold macaw, Cockatiel, and Monk parakeet positive plasma, while anti-duck IgY secondary antibody produced significantly (P<0.05) stronger signals than the other secondary antibodies in Mallard positive plasma.

Frailty Hinders Recovery From Acute Respiratory Illness in Older Adults,"BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination programs aim to prevent serious outcomes. Given that frailty may impact recovery from influenza, we examined frailty as a predictor of recovery in older adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. METHODS: Data came from the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network during the 2011/12, 2012/13, and 2013/14 influenza seasons; all patients were aged 65+. Frailty was measured using a previously validated Frailty Index (FI) of health and functional deficits; baseline frailty was categorized using published cutoffs (0-.1 non-frail, >.1-.21 pre-frail, >.21-.45 frail, >.45 most frail). Recovery was operationalized as being alive 30 days post-discharge with less than two additional health/functional deficits (<=0.06 FI increase). Logistic regression was used to examine the change in odds of recovery for every 0.1 increase in baseline FI, controlling for age, sex, season, lab-confirmed influenza status, and seasonal influenza vaccination status. RESULTS: Of 5125 hospitalized older adults, 15% were non-frail, 39% pre-frail, 40% frail, and 6% most frail. 11% died, and poor recovery was experienced by 520/4544=11% of survivors. Poor recovery was inversely associated with baseline frailty (11% non-frail, 17% pre-frail, 28% frail, 38% most frail; P < .001). Frailty was associated with lower odds of recovery in all three seasons [2011/12 (OR=0.71; 95% CI 0.60–0.85), 2012/13 (OR=0.72; 0.66–0.78), 2013/14 (OR=0.76; 0.70–0.82)] though results varied by season, influenza status, and vaccination status. In 2011/12, frailty was associated with poor recovery in unvaccinated (OR=0.46. 95% CI=0.32–0.67) but not vaccinated older patients (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.68–1.02). CONCLUSION: Increasing frailty was consistently associated with lower odds of recovery in older adults admitted with influenza and other acute respiratory illnesses; depending on seasonal factors, vaccination may offer some buffering of this impact. Understanding frailty and functional status is important, both because frailty is predictive of poor recovery and because persistence of new health/functional deficits is an adverse outcome with important implications for patients, families and health systems.

Study to Address Threats of Acute Respiratory Infections among Congregate Military Populations (ATARI),"BACKGROUND: More than 90% of active duty personnel receive influenza vaccinations yearly. Despite high coverage, influenza-like illnesses (ILI) remain a frequent cause of missed duty and hospitalizations, particularly in U.S. military recruits. More research is needed on the epidemiology and etiology of ILI to reduce the burden of respiratory infections in congregated military settings. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess ILI patterns among US Army recruits in a 9-week basic combat training course at Ft. Benning, GA. Demographic data, vaccination history, and information on recent illness were collected at enrollment in January 2017. Participants were divided into two platoons with staggered biweekly visit schedules. Visits occurred from reception through training, with nasal swabs and symptom surveys (all visits) and blood draws (weeks 8 and 9). Nasal specimens were used to detect clinical and colonizing pathogens using the Diatherix TEM-PCR Respiratory Panel. RESULTS: A total of 90 recruits were enrolled in the study. Twelve recruits were lost due to training attrition in the first week of the study. The participants were male and the mean age was 23 yo (SD 4.9). There were 10 (13%) cases of ILI reported among the 78 remaining participants, 6 in week 1, 3 in week 2 and 1 in week 9. The most frequently detected pathogens in the 10 symptomatic cases were coronavirus (5, 50%), rhinovirus (4, 40%), other enterovirus (3, 30%), and influenza A (2, 20%). Pathogen co-detections were common, 8 out 10 cases were associated with 2 pathogens, representing 7 unique combinations. While rhinovirus and coronavirus were most common among asymptomatic trainees, 10% had detectable influenza A. Detection of multiple pathogens was common in the first two weeks of training (50% among those who had viral detection). The study is still in progress. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic ILI was associated with coronavirus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus, in addition to influenza in the early weeks of training. Coronavirus and rhinovirus also circulated widely among healthy recruits, along with influenza. The findings will inform ILI control strategies for congregated military trainees. DISCLOSURES: E.

"Analysis of the misdiagnosis of 8 adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan","OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical characteristics of adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, analyze the causes of misdiagnosis, and improve the levels of clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data and diagnosis and treatment of 8 adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation that were diagnosed in the Oncology Department of People’s hospital of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture from July 2014 to July 2019. RESULT: All 8 patients were from epidemic paragonimiasis areas and had a confirmed history of consuming uncooked freshwater crabs. The clinical manifestations were mainly fever, dry cough, and chest pain. The disease durations were long, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were elevated. The cases had been misdiagnosed as pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis. After years of anti-inflammatory or anti-tuberculosis treatment, the symptoms had not improved significantly. Patients eventually sought treatment from the oncology department for hemoptysis. Chest computed tomography showed patchy consolidation in the lungs, with nodules, lung masses, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: Paragonimiasis is a food-borne parasitic disease. Early clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results are nonspecific. The parasite most often invades the lungs, and the resulting disease is often misdiagnosed as pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, or lung cancer (Acta Trop 199: 05074, 2019). To avoid misdiagnosis, clinicians should inquire, in detail, about residence history and history of unclean food and exposure to infected water and make an early diagnosis based on the inquired information and imaging examination results. For patients who have been diagnosed with pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis and whose symptoms do not improve significantly after anti-inflammatory or anti-tuberculosis treatments, their epidemiological history should be traced to further conduct differential diagnosis and avoid misdiagnosis.",0,"Analysis of the misdiagnosis of 8 adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical characteristics of adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, analyze the causes of misdiagnosis, and improve the levels of clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Predictors of Anxiety-Induced Sleep Disturbance among in-School Adolescents in Ghana: Evidence from the 2012 Global School-Based Health Survey,"(1) Background: Psychological problems of adolescents have become a global health and safety concern. Empirical evidence has shown that adolescents experience diverse mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, and emotional disorders). However, research on anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among in-school adolescents has received less attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This study’s central focus was to examine factors associated with t anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among in-school adolescents in Ghana. (2) Methods: Analysis was performed using the 2012 Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS). A sample of 1342 in-school adolescents was included in the analysis. The outcome variable was anxiety-induced sleep disturbance reported during the past 12 months. Frequencies, percentages, chi-square, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results from the multivariable logistic regression analysis were presented as crude and adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and with a statistical significance declared at p < 0.05. (3) Results: Adolescents who went hungry were more likely to report anxiety-induced sleep disturbance compared to their counterparts who did not report hunger (aOR = 1.68, CI = 1.10, 2.57). The odds of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance were higher among adolescents who felt lonely compared to those that never felt lonely (aOR = 2.82, CI = 1.98, 4.01). Adolescents who had sustained injury were more likely to have anxiety-induced sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.49, CI = 1.03, 2.14) compared to those who had no injury. Compared to adolescents who never had suicidal ideations, those who reported experiencing suicidal ideations had higher odds of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.68, CI = 1.05, 2.71). (4) Conclusions: Anxiety-induced sleep disturbance among in-school adolescents were significantly influenced by the psychosocial determinants such as hunger, loneliness, injury, and suicidal ideation in this study. The findings can help design appropriate interventions through effective strategies (e.g., early school-based screening, cognitive-behavioral therapy, face-face counseling services) to reduce psychosocial problems among in-school adolescents in Ghana.",0,"Predictors of Anxiety-Induced Sleep Disturbance among in-School Adolescents in Ghana: Evidence from the 2012 Global School-Based Health Survey (1) Background: Psychological problems of adolescents have become a global health and safety concern.

Genome Number and Size Polymorphism in Zika Virus Infectious Units,"Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is an arthropod-borne infection that can result in severe outcomes, particularly in fetuses infected in utero. It has been assumed that infection by ZIKV, as well as other viruses, is largely initiated by individual virus particles binding to and entering a cell. However, recent studies have demonstrated that multiple virus particles are frequently delivered to a cell simultaneously and that this collective particle delivery enhances infection. ZIKV is maintained in nature between Aedes aegypti mosquitos and vertebrate hosts, including humans. Human infection is initiated through the injection of a relatively small initial inoculum comprised of a genetically complex virus population. Since most mutations decrease virus fitness, collective particle transmission could benefit ZIKV and other arthropod-borne diseases by facilitating the maintenance of genetic complexity and adaptability during infection or through other mechanisms. Therefore, we utilized a barcoded ZIKV to quantify the number of virus genomes that initiate a plaque. We found that individual plaques contain a mean of 10 infecting viral genomes (range, 1 to 212). Few plaques contained more than two dominant genomes. To determine whether multigenome infectious units consist of collectively transmitting virions, infectious units of ZIKV were then separated mechanically by centrifugation, and heavier fractions were found to contain more genomes per plaque-forming unit, with larger diameters. Finally, larger/heavier infectious units reformed after removal. These data suggest that ZIKV populations consist of a variety of infectious unit sizes, likely mostly made up of aggregates, and only rarely begin with a single virus genome. IMPORTANCE The arthropod-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) infects humans and can cause severe neurological sequelae, particularly in fetuses infected in utero. How this virus has been able to spread across vast geological ranges and evolve in new host populations is not yet understood. This research demonstrates a novel mechanism of ZIKV transmission through multigenome aggregates, providing insight into ZIKV evolution, immunologic evasion, and better future therapeutic design. This study shows that ZIKV plaques result from collections of genomes rather than individual genomes, increasing the potential for interactions between ZIKV genotypes.",0,"Genome Number and Size Polymorphism in Zika Virus Infectious Units Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is an arthropod-borne infection that can result in severe outcomes, particularly in fetuses infected in utero.

Direct Visualization of Ebola Virus Fusion Triggering in the Endocytic Pathway,"Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection. Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion—triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing—by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7(+)) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.",0,"Direct Visualization of Ebola Virus Fusion Triggering in the Endocytic Pathway Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection.

Clinic leaders reported accessing information about innovations mainly from government agencies, professional associations, peer organizations, and research literature. Leaders mentioned an average of two external sources of information. There was evidence of variation in how leaders accessed information and how information about innovations was communicated within clinics.

Influenza A virus targets a cGAS-independent STING pathway that controls enveloped RNA viruses,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is known be involved in control of DNA viruses but has an unexplored role in control of RNA viruses. During infection with DNA viruses STING is activated downstream of cGAMP synthase (cGAS) to induce type I interferon. Here we identify a STING-dependent, cGAS-independent pathway important for full interferon production and antiviral control of enveloped RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Further, IAV interacts with STING through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP). Interestingly, FP antagonizes interferon production induced by membrane fusion or IAV but not by cGAMP or DNA. Similar to the enveloped RNA viruses, membrane fusion stimulates interferon production in a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent manner. Abolishment of this pathway led to reduced interferon production and impaired control of enveloped RNA viruses. Thus, enveloped RNA viruses stimulate a cGAS-independent STING pathway, which is targeted by IAV.",0,"Influenza A virus targets a cGAS-independent STING pathway that controls enveloped RNA viruses Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is known be involved in control of DNA viruses but has an unexplored role in control of RNA viruses.

Thus, enveloped RNA viruses stimulate a cGAS-independent STING pathway, which is targeted by IAV.",influenza a virus targets a cgasindependent sting pathway that controls enveloped rna viruses stimulator of interferon genes sting is known be involved in control of dna viruses but has an unexplored role in control of rna viruses during infection with dna viruses sting is activated downstream of cgamp synthase cgas to induce type i interferon here we identify a stingdependent cgasindependent pathway important for full interferon production and antiviral control of enveloped rna viruses including influenza a virus iav further iav interacts with sting through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide fp interestingly fp antagonizes interferon production induced by membrane fusion or iav but not by cgamp or dna similar to the enveloped rna viruses membrane fusion stimulates interferon production in a stingdependent but cgasindependent manner abolishment of this pathway led to reduced interferon production and impaired control of enveloped rna viruses thus enveloped rna viruses stimulate a cgasindependent sting pathway which is targeted by iav,1
Mechanism of Fibronectin Binding to Human Trabecular Meshwork Exosomes and Its Modulation by Dexamethasone,"Exosomes are emerging as important mediators of cell-matrix interactions by means of specific adhesion proteins. Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called “invadosomes”. Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients.",0,"Mechanism of Fibronectin Binding to Human Trabecular Meshwork Exosomes and Its Modulation by Dexamethasone Exosomes are emerging as important mediators of cell-matrix interactions by means of specific adhesion proteins.
