Identification of one B-cell epitope from NS1 protein of duck Tembusu virus with monoclonal antibodies,"

This study presents the identification of a B-cell epitope from the NS1 protein of Duck Tembusu virus, using monoclonal antibodies. Analysis of various antigenic regions in this pathogen found one conformational contiguous epitope with high binding affinity for Mouse Monoclonal Antibody 2G9 (MAb2G9). Further examination revealed MAb peptide interaction through hydrogen bonding and conformational entropy changes before the determination of its exact amino acid sequence. In conclusion, an isolated epitope was responsible for antigen recognition by monoclonal antibodies which can be used to design novel vaccine candidates against duck Tembusu virus infection in poultry flocks.",1,"Identification of one B-cell epitope from NS1 protein of duck Tembusu virus with monoclonal antibodies

Volatile fingerprinting of human respiratory viruses from cell culture,"

This research paper presents the volatile fingerprinting technique utilized to identify human respiratory viruses from cell culture. An aerosol sampling system was used to generate air samples of up to 0.25 liters, collected during viral replication in various types of cell cultures – Vero E6, LLC-PK1, Sp2/0 and MDCK II cell lines. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a wide range of known volatile compounds were detected using retention time indices through library matching with Wakitta’s standard reference collection for volatiles and Pherobank for semiochemicals used to study biodiversity distribution patterns. The ability to detect specific chemicals present within certain viruses can be attributed largely in part to their lifestyle as obligate intracellular parasites, causing them to interact more closely with host cells than extracellular viruses do. Volatile fingerprinting provides an additional tool that could be useful when attemptingto identify common human respiratory pathogens accurately and rapidly which would form the basis of early diagnosis or surveillance purposes at point of care facilities or other medical institutions worldwide ",1,"Volatile fingerprinting of human respiratory viruses from cell culture

Archaeal DnaG contains a conserved N-terminal RNA-binding domain and enables tailing of rRNA by the exosome,"

This study provides evidence for the presence of a conserved N-terminal RNA-binding domain within Aquifex pyrophilus DnaG, an archaeal form of primase. Priming and tailing are essential steps during rRNA maturation that allow correct folding of the molecule into its three-dimensional structure. Using electron microscopy, biochemical fractionation combined with transcriptomic studies on A. pyrophilus cells grown under protein synthesis-limiting conditions, we show that the N-terminal region specifically binds to mature 5S/23S rRNA molecules and protected them from degradation by RNases in vitro; moreover, it is required for efficient exosome association and 3' end formation through CCA addition. Our work reveals DnaG as a novel platform mediating the primosome assembly onto preprocessed ribonucleoprotein particles in archaea and establishes a role for it in forming correct folds of functional 25S rRNAs which facilitate their biogenesis.",1,"Archaeal DnaG contains a conserved N-terminal RNA-binding domain and enables tailing of rRNA by the exosome

Soluble Form of Canine Transferrin Receptor Inhibits Canine Parvovirus Infection In Vitro and In Vivo,"

This study focuses on the potential of using the soluble form of canine transferrin receptor (sTfR) as an inhibitor of canine parvovirus (CPV2) infection both in vitro and in vivo. Using an advanced production method, CPV2-specific sTfR was produced that demonstrated a higher binding capacity and neutralizing antibody activity when compared to its native form. Vaccination with purified recombinant sTfR provided significant protection from CPV2 infection for 84 days in dogs infected with viremia levels exceeding 1:1,200 dilutions; 90% neutralization at different subtypes of CPV2 could also be observed. In vitro studies revealed reduced infectivity by purine inhibition and toxicity assays, suggesting additional functional properties were established due to posttranslational modifications incorporated during protein expression. These results suggest that sTfR is a promising candidate molecule for use as an inhibitor or vaccine platform against CPV2 infection in infectious disease research or veterinary clinical settings.",1,"Soluble Form of Canine Transferrin Receptor Inhibits Canine Parvovirus Infection In Vitro and In Vivo

Our results indicate that while binding and crosslinking of DNA to mRNA detectable by immunofluorescence are highly correlated with RNA translation, protein labeling is not reliable at such small scales. We reveal that coordination between post-transcriptional modifications including 5' and 3'end-processing do not allow for endstation localization on a subcellular level, leading to misinterpretations about gene expression regulation at these temporal resolutions. This suggests prudence when assessing mammalian cell activity solely off of indirect readouts from non-specific commodities such as puromycin.

"Spanish Validation for Olfactory Function Testing Using the Sniffin’ Sticks Olfactory Test: Threshold, Discrimination, and Identification","

This study aimed to provide Spanish validation for the Sniffin’ Sticks Olfactory Test (SOST), which is well-established and provides reliable results for measuring olfactory function. The data collected from 123 participants aged 18 years or older living in northern Spain analyzed three factors of the SOST: threshold, discrimination, and identification. Results from this study showed that SOST is a valid tool using Spanish instructions with good reliability coefficients for all three factors tested—therefore its use may be recommended as a psychometric instrument to assess olfactory impairment among Spanish populations seeking medical advice about their sense of smell. In addition, further research into individual assessment components could benefit our understanding of test validity in different patient samples and help to optimize the diagnostic use of this sensitive measure.",1,"Spanish Validation for Olfactory Function Testing Using the Sniffin’ Sticks Olfactory Test: Threshold, Discrimination, and Identification

Transplantation of highly purified peripheral blood CD34(+) cells from HLA-mismatched parental donors in 14 children: evaluation of early monitoring of engraftment,"


This study evaluates the efficacy of transplantation utilizing highly purified peripheral blood CD34(+) cells from HLA-mismatched parental donors in fourteen children with leukemia and other conditions. To assess early monitoring of engraftment, we analyzed clinical outcomes pre- and post-transplantation including primary hematological recovery following myeloablative chemotherapy. We measured engraftment time, rate of neutrophil and platelet donor chimerism 3 months after transplantation, as well as acute graft versus host disease risk factors. The results indicate that it is feasible to use parental haploidentical CD34(+) cell transplants for pediatric patients receiving therapy for leukemic or immune deficiency diseases. Further, we have displayed an effective strategy to achieve rapid and durable full donor chimerism over 90% which should be indicative of functional immune reconstitution without development of acute graft versus host disease.?",1,"Transplantation of highly purified peripheral blood CD34(+) cells from HLA-mismatched parental donors in 14 children: evaluation of early monitoring of engraftment

Interaction of a Densovirus with Glycans of the Peritrophic Matrix Mediates Oral Infection of the Lepidopteran Pest Spodoptera frugiperda,"

The effectiveness of insecticides to control lepidopteran pests, such as corn earworm Spodoptera frugiperda (S. Frugiperda), is being hampered by the development of resistance in field populations. Recent studies have implicated viruses in several ecological processes; however, an understanding of the interaction between densoviruses and peritrophic matrix proteins involved in oral infection remains largely unknown. Here we present a study investigating how densoviruses exploit the glycans within S. frugiperda’s peritrophic matrix for efficient oral transmission. Through quantitative PCR screening and gene editing, we demonstrate that this virus recognizes and exploits specific peritrophic glycan motifs which modulate their affinity for binding host receptors and ultimately increase viral infectivity via externalization. Our findings suggest possible regulatory strategies related to controlling S. frugiperda by blocking its recognition or attachment to certain glycans in order to constrain disease outbreaks, rather than relying on costly chemical pesticides alone.

The emergence of drug-resistant strains of influenza is a concerning challenge for every pandemic control program. Here, we studied the impact of an oseltamivir resistance mutation in H1N1 2009 subtype neuraminidase (NA). Using reverse genetics, recombinant viruses containing the H275Y mutation were generated and characterized regarding NA activity and viral fitness. We found that the resistant virus loses about half its enzyme activity versus wild type strains but showed only marginal decreases in terms of infectivity, replication kinetics and growth yields. Thus, our findings confirm previous reports suggesting small compromise with regard to both enzymatic function and viral fitness when this drug-resistance marker appears in currently circulating seasonal or pandemic influenza A virus isolates.",1,"Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus with the H275Y oseltamivir resistance neuraminidase mutation shows a small compromise in enzyme activity and viral fitness
