The “wicked problems” of governing UK health security disaster prevention: The case of pandemic influenza,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine the governance and policy-making challenges in the context of “wicked problems” based on the case of pandemic influenza. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The case study research is based on an analysis of official documentation and interviews with policy elites at multiple levels of UK governance. FINDINGS: Results of this study show that policy actors regard risk communication, the dynamics of international public policy and UK territorial governance as the main governance challenges in the management of influenza at a macro-level. The paper also serves to identify that although contingencies management for epidemiological issues require technical and scientific considerations to feature in governance arrangements, equally there are key “wicked problems” in the context public policy that pervade the health security sector. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study indicates the need to build in resources at a national level to plan for policy coordination challenges in areas that might at first be seen as devoid of political machinations (such as technical areas of public policy that might be underpinned by epidemiological processes). The identification of the major governance challenges that emerge from the pandemic influenza case study is a springboard for a research agenda in relation to the analysis of the parallels and paradoxes of governance challenges for health security across EU member states. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper provides a novel interrogation of the pandemic influenza case study in the context of UK governance and public policy by providing a strategic policy lens from perspective of elites.",0,"The “wicked problems” of governing UK health security disaster prevention: The case of pandemic influenza PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine the governance and policy-making challenges in the context of “wicked problems” based on the case of pandemic influenza.

Bioinformatics analysis of calcium-dependent protein kinase 4 (CDPK4) as Toxoplasma gondii vaccine target,"OBJECTIVES: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite, could affect numerous warm-blooded animals, such as humans. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are essential Ca(2+) signaling mediators and participate in parasite host cell egress, outer membrane motility, invasion, and cell division. RESULTS: Several bioinformatics online servers were employed to analyze and predict the important properties of CDPK4 protein. The findings revealed that CDPK4 peptide has 1158 amino acid residues with average molecular weight (MW) of 126.331 KDa. The aliphatic index and GRAVY for this protein were estimated at 66.82 and – 0.650, respectively. The findings revealed that the CDPK4 protein comprised 30.14% and 34.97% alpha-helix, 59.84% and 53.54% random coils, and 10.02% and 11.49% extended strand with SOPMA and GOR4 tools, respectively. Ramachandran plot output showed 87.87%, 8.40%, and 3.73% of amino acid residues in the favored, allowed, and outlier regions, respectively. Also, several potential B and T-cell epitopes were predicted for CDPK4 protein through different bioinformatics tools. Also, antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation demonstrated that this protein has immunogenic and non-allergenic nature. This paper presents a basis for further studies, thereby provides a fundamental basis for the development of an effective vaccine against T. gondii infection.",0,"Bioinformatics analysis of calcium-dependent protein kinase 4 (CDPK4) as Toxoplasma gondii vaccine target OBJECTIVES: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite, could affect numerous warm-blooded animals, such as humans.

Flux sampling is a powerful tool to study metabolism under changing environmental conditions,"The development of high-throughput ‘omic techniques has sparked a rising interest in genome-scale metabolic models, with applications ranging from disease diagnostics to crop adaptation. Efficient and accurate methods are required to analyze large metabolic networks. Flux sampling can be used to explore the feasible flux solutions in metabolic networks by generating probability distributions of steady-state reaction fluxes. Unlike other methods, flux sampling can be used without assuming a particular cellular objective. We have undertaken a rigorous comparison of several sampling algorithms and concluded that the coordinate hit-and-run with rounding (CHRR) algorithm is the most efficient based on both run-time and multiple convergence diagnostics. We demonstrate the power of CHRR by using it to study the metabolic changes that underlie photosynthetic acclimation to cold of Arabidopsis thaliana plant leaves. In combination with experimental measurements, we show how the regulated interplay between diurnal starch and organic acid accumulation defines the plant acclimation process. We confirm fumarate accumulation as a requirement for cold acclimation and further predict γ–aminobutyric acid to have a key role in metabolic signaling under cold conditions. These results demonstrate how flux sampling can be used to analyze the feasible flux solutions across changing environmental conditions, whereas eliminating the need to make assumptions which introduce observer bias.",0,"Flux sampling is a powerful tool to study metabolism under changing environmental conditions The development of high-throughput ‘omic techniques has sparked a rising interest in genome-scale metabolic models, with applications ranging from disease diagnostics to crop adaptation.

Towards Merging Models of Information Spreading and Dynamic Phenomena in Social Networks,"While the impact of network properties on information spreading is now widely studied, influence of network dynamics is very little known. In this paper, we study how evolution mechanisms traditionally observed within social networks can affect information diffusion. We present an approach that merges two models: model of information diffusion through social networks and model of network evolution. Since epidemics provide a reference in application domains of information spreading, we measure the impact of basic network structure changes on epidemic peak value and timing. Then we investigate observed trends in terms of changes appearing in the network structure. Our results provide promising results on how and why network dynamics is a strong parameter to integrate in requirements for information spreading modelling.",0,"Towards Merging Models of Information Spreading and Dynamic Phenomena in Social Networks While the impact of network properties on information spreading is now widely studied, influence of network dynamics is very little known.

Genomic investigation of piglet resilience following porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes malabsorptive watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes in pigs. Since the 1970s, PED outbreaks have become a source of problems in pig producing countries all over the world, causing large economic losses for pig producers. Although the infection in adults is not fatal, in naïve suckling piglets mortality is close to 100%. In this study, we investigated genome‐wide differences between dead and recovered suckling piglets from commercial farms after PED outbreaks. Samples from 262 animals (156 dead and 106 recovered) belonging to several commercial lines were collected from five different farms in three different countries (USA, Canada and Germany) and genotyped with the porcine 80K SNP chip. Mean F (st) value was calculated in 1‐Mb non‐overlapping windows between dead and recovered individuals, and the results were normalized to find differences within the comparison. Seven windows with high divergence between dead and recovered were detected—five on chromosome 2, one on chromosome 4 and one on chromosome 15—in total encompassing 152 genes. Several of these genes are either under‐ or overexpressed in many virus infections, including Coronaviridae (such as SARS‐CoV). A total of 32 genes are included in one or more Gene Ontology terms that can be related to PED development, such as Golgi apparatus, as well as mechanisms generally linked to resilience or diarrhea development (cell proliferation, ion transport, ATPase activity). Taken together this information provides a first genomic picture of PEDV resilience in suckling piglets.",0,"Genomic investigation of piglet resilience following porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes malabsorptive watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes in pigs.

The Battle between Virus and Host: Modulation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathways by Virus Infection,"In order to establish an infection, viruses need to either suppress or escape from host immune defense systems. Recent immunological research has focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense, especially pattern recognition molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Various microbial components are recognized by their vague and common molecular shapes so-called, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs induce inflammatory reactions mediated by the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, and by interferons, which lead to an antiviral immune response. Viruses have the capacity to suppress or escape from this pattern recognition molecule-mediated antimicrobial response in various ways. In this paper, we review the various strategies used by viruses to modulate the pattern recognition molecule-mediated innate immune response.",0,"The Battle between Virus and Host: Modulation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathways by Virus Infection In order to establish an infection, viruses need to either suppress or escape from host immune defense systems.

Postnatal steroid management in preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly affecting extremely preterm infants. Although mechanical ventilation and oxygen requirements in premature infants are identified as inciting mechanisms for inflammation and the development of BPD over time, data now support an array of perinatal events that may stimulate the inflammatory cascade prior to delivery. Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, have proven beneficial for the prevention and management of BPD postnatally due to their anti-inflammatory characteristics. This review aims to examine the pharmacologic properties of several corticosteroids, appraise the existing evidence for postnatal corticosteroid use in preterm infants, and assess steroid management strategies to ameliorate BPD. Finally, we aim to provide guidance based on clinical experience for managing adrenal suppression resulting from prolonged steroid exposure since this is an area less well-studied.",0,"Postnatal steroid management in preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly affecting extremely preterm infants.

Non-UV germicidal activity of fresh TiO(2) and Ag/TiO(2),"Fresh TiO(2) was found to possess a strong germicidal activity even without UV irradiation. Live Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells in contact with fresh TiO(2) were found deformed and dead after 15 min contact. The cause of germicidal activity was discussed from the observed cell deformation, lysis and increased absorption at 1680 cm(−1) in FT-IR spectra of the affected cells, which proved the oxidizing effect of fresh TiO(2) to cells. The deformation caused by the stretching of cell wall and pressure built-up inside the cell, led to cell burst and release of intracellular materials. The degree of cell deformation was found positively related with the wetting property of TiO(2). Cells are negatively charged, for Gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than Gram-positive cells. The germicidal effect of TiO(2) gradually decreased after exposure to air at room temperature, as the wetting property decreased. This kind of germicidal activity was more effective compared to other germicidal process such as UVA/TiO(2) or Ag(+). This shed light on designing new germicidal material either maintained by visible light irradiation, or by oxidation effect generated by reactive oxygen species.",0,"Non-UV germicidal activity of fresh TiO(2) and Ag/TiO(2) Fresh TiO(2) was found to possess a strong germicidal activity even without UV irradiation.

Therapeutic Delivery of Ang(1–7) via Genetically Modified Probiotic: A Dosing Study,"In recent years a number of beneficial health effects have been ascribed to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that extend beyond lowering blood pressure, primarily mediated via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (1–7) or Ang(1–7)/MAS receptor axis. Moreover, once thought as merely a systemic effector, RAS components exist within tissues. The highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are located in the gut making it an important target for altering RAS function. Indeed, genetically engineered recombinant probiotics are promising treatment strategies offering delivery of therapeutic proteins with precision. An Ang(1–7) secreting Lactobacillus paracasei (LP) or LP-A has been described for regulation of diabetes and hypertension; however, we are the first to the best of our knowledge to propose this paradigm as it relates to aging. In this Research Practice manuscript, we provide proof of concept for using this technology in a well-characterized rodent model of aging: the Fisher344 x Brown Norway Rat (F344BN). Our primary findings suggest that LP-A increases circulating levels of Ang(1–7) both acutely and chronically (after 8 or 28 treatment days) when administered 3× or 7×/week over 4 weeks. Our future preclinical studies will explore the impact of this treatment on gut and other age-sensitive distal tissues such as brain and muscle.",0,"Therapeutic Delivery of Ang(1–7) via Genetically Modified Probiotic: A Dosing Study In recent years a number of beneficial health effects have been ascribed to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that extend beyond lowering blood pressure, primarily mediated via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (1–7) or Ang(1–7)/MAS receptor axis.

"Association between pet ownership and physical activity levels, atopic conditions, and mental health in Singapore: a propensity score-matched analysis","Although existing literature increasingly suggests a positive influence of pet ownership on human physical activity levels, results from many European, American, and Japanese studies have been inconsistent. How pet ownership impacts mental health and atopy is likewise controversial and whether distinct demographic subgroups experience differential effects is unclear. This cross-sectional study surveyed participants (n = 823) via a self-administered online questionnaire. Comparisons of outcomes between pet owners and non-pet owners with subgroup analyses were performed within a propensity score-matched subset (n = 566) of respondents. There were no differences in physical activity levels or mental health scores between pet owners and non-pet owners. In subgroup analyses, compared to non-pet owners, main pet caregivers reported 14.1 (95% CI 2.79–25.3) and 19.0 (95% CI 4.70–33.3) more minutes per week of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity respectively and higher SF-36 emotional well-being (β = 2.7, 95% CI 0.100–5.32) and energy scores (β = 3.8, 95% CI 0.410–7.27).

How pet ownership impacts mental health and atopy is likewise controversial and whether distinct demographic subgroups experience differential effects is unclear. This cross-sectional study surveyed participants (n = 823) via a self-administered online questionnaire. Comparisons of outcomes between pet owners and non-pet owners with subgroup analyses were performed within a propensity score-matched subset (n = 566) of respondents. There were no differences in physical activity levels or mental health scores between pet owners and non-pet owners. In subgroup analyses, compared to non-pet owners, main pet caregivers reported 14.1 (95% CI 2.79–25.3) and 19.0 (95% CI 4.70–33.3) more minutes per week of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity respectively and higher SF-36 emotional well-being (β = 2.7, 95% CI 0.100–5.32) and energy scores (β = 3.8, 95% CI 0.410–7.27).

Chikungunya Virus Fidelity Variants Exhibit Differential Attenuation and Population Diversity in Cell Culture and Adult Mice,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging global health threat that produces debilitating arthritis in people. Like other RNA viruses with high mutation rates, CHIKV produces populations of genetically diverse genomes within a host. While several known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes, the role of intrahost diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease has not been studied. In this study, high- and low-fidelity CHIKV variants, previously characterized by altered in vitro population mutation frequencies, were used to evaluate how intrahost diversity influences clinical disease, CHIKV replication, and antibody neutralization in immunocompetent adult mice inoculated in the rear footpads. Both high- and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV. Unexpectedly, high-fidelity mutants elicited more severe arthritic disease than the WT despite comparable CHIKV replication, whereas a low-fidelity mutant produced attenuated disease and replication. Serum antibody developed against both high- and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibited reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the high-fidelity mutations were demonstrated to be genetically stable but produced more genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV in mice. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passage. The NGS results contrast with previously reported population diversities for fidelity variants, which focused mainly on part of the E1 gene, and highlight the need for direct measurements of mutation rates to clarify CHIKV fidelity phenotypes. IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a reemerging global health threat that elicits debilitating arthritis in humans. There are currently no commercially available CHIKV vaccines. Like other RNA viruses, CHIKV has a high mutation rate and is capable of rapid intrahost diversification during an infection. In other RNA viruses, virus population diversity associates with disease progression; however, potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity on CHIKV arthritic disease have not been studied. Using previously characterized CHIKV fidelity variants, we addressed whether CHIKV population diversity influences the severity of arthritis and host antibody response in an arthritic mouse model. Our findings show that CHIKV populations with greater genetic diversity can cause more severe disease and stimulate antibody responses with reduced neutralization of low-diversity virus populations in vitro. The discordant high-fidelity phenotypes in this study highlight the complexity of inferring replication fidelity indirectly from population diversity.",0,"Chikungunya Virus Fidelity Variants Exhibit Differential Attenuation and Population Diversity in Cell Culture and Adult Mice Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging global health threat that produces debilitating arthritis in people.

Hybrid Basketball Game Outcome Prediction Model by Integrating Data Mining Methods for the National Basketball Association,"The sports market has grown rapidly over the last several decades. Sports outcomes prediction is an attractive sports analytic challenge as it provides useful information for operations in the sports market. In this study, a hybrid basketball game outcomes prediction scheme is developed for predicting the final score of the National Basketball Association (NBA) games by integrating five data mining techniques, including extreme learning machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, k-nearest neighbors, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stochastic gradient boosting. Designed features are generated by merging different game-lags information from fundamental basketball statistics and used in the proposed scheme. This study collected data from all the games of the NBA 2018–2019 seasons. There are 30 teams in the NBA and each team play 82 games per season. A total of 2460 NBA game data points were collected. Empirical results illustrated that the proposed hybrid basketball game prediction scheme achieves high prediction performance and identifies suitable game-lag information and relevant game features (statistics). Our findings suggested that a two-stage XGBoost model using four pieces of game-lags information achieves the best prediction performance among all competing models. The six designed features, including averaged defensive rebounds, averaged two-point field goal percentage, averaged free throw percentage, averaged offensive rebounds, averaged assists, and averaged three-point field goal attempts, from four game-lags have a greater effect on the prediction of final scores of NBA games than other game-lags. The findings of this study provide relevant insights and guidance for other team or individual sports outcomes prediction research.",0,"Hybrid Basketball Game Outcome Prediction Model by Integrating Data Mining Methods for the National Basketball Association The sports market has grown rapidly over the last several decades.

ExoU-induced redox imbalance and oxidative stress in airway epithelial cells during Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumosepsis,"ExoU is a potent proinflammatory toxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major agent of severe lung infection and sepsis. Because inflammation is usually associated with oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of ExoU on free radical production and antioxidant defense mechanisms during the course of P. aeruginosa infection. In an experimental model of acute pneumonia, ExoU accounted for increased lipid peroxidation in mice lungs as soon as 3 h after intratracheal instillation of PA103 P. aeruginosa strain. The contribution of airway cells to the generation of a redox imbalance was assessed by in vitro tests carried out with A549 airway epithelial cells. Cultures infected with the ExoU-producing PA103 P. aeruginosa strain produced significantly increased concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides, 8-isoprostane, reactive oxygen intermediates, peroxynitrite and nitric oxide (NO), when compared to cells infected with exoU-deficient mutants. Overproduction of NO by PA103-infected cells likely resulted from overexpression of both inducible and endothelial NO synthase isoforms. PA103 infection was also associated with a significantly increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant compound. Our findings unveil another potential mechanism of tissue damage during infection by ExoU-producing P. aeruginosa strains.",0,"ExoU-induced redox imbalance and oxidative stress in airway epithelial cells during Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumosepsis ExoU is a potent proinflammatory toxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major agent of severe lung infection and sepsis.

Health System Resource Gaps and Associated Mortality from Pandemic Influenza across Six Asian Territories,"BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia has been the focus of considerable investment in pandemic influenza preparedness. Given the wide variation in socio-economic conditions, health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations. We aimed to estimate and compare the resource gaps, and potential mortalities associated with those gaps, for responding to pandemic influenza within and between six territories in Asia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected health system resource data from Cambodia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali), Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. We applied a mathematical transmission model to simulate a “mild-to-moderate” pandemic influenza scenario to estimate resource needs, gaps, and attributable mortalities at province level within each territory. The results show that wide variations exist in resource capacities between and within the six territories, with substantial mortalities predicted as a result of resource gaps (referred to here as “avoidable” mortalities), particularly in poorer areas. Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators were estimated to be a major cause of avoidable mortalities in all territories except Taiwan. Other resources (oseltamivir, hospital beds and human resources) are inequitably distributed within countries. Estimates of resource gaps and avoidable mortalities were highly sensitive to model parameters defining the transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic scenario. However, geographic patterns observed within and across territories remained similar for the range of parameter values explored. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for where (both geographically and in terms of which resource types) investment is most needed, and the potential impact of resource mobilization for mitigating the disease burden of an influenza pandemic. Effective mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could go some way towards minimizing avoidable deaths.",0,"Health System Resource Gaps and Associated Mortality from Pandemic Influenza across Six Asian Territories BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia has been the focus of considerable investment in pandemic influenza preparedness.

Cytoplasmic sharing through apical membrane remodeling,"Multiple nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm are found in diverse tissues, organisms, and diseases. Yet, multinucleation remains a poorly understood biological property. Cytoplasm sharing invariably involves plasma membrane breaches. In contrast, we discovered cytoplasm sharing without membrane breaching in highly resorptive Drosophila rectal papillae. During a six-hour developmental window, 100 individual papillar cells assemble a multinucleate cytoplasm, allowing passage of proteins of at least 62 kDa throughout papillar tissue. Papillar cytoplasm sharing does not employ canonical mechanisms such as incomplete cytokinesis or muscle fusion pore regulators. Instead, sharing requires gap junction proteins (normally associated with transport of molecules < 1 kDa), which are positioned by membrane remodeling GTPases. Our work reveals a new role for apical membrane remodeling in converting a multicellular epithelium into a giant multinucleate cytoplasm.",0,"Cytoplasmic sharing through apical membrane remodeling Multiple nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm are found in diverse tissues, organisms, and diseases.

Noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute respiratory failure: a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is one of the leading causes of intensive care unit admission and is associated with high mortality. Noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as high-flow nasal cannula, standard oxygen therapy, and noninvasive ventilation (delivered by either face mask or helmet interface) are widely available interventions applied in these patients. It remains unclear which of these interventions are more effective in decreasing rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence and compare the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies on mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: We will search key databases for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We will exclude studies in which the primary focus is either acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (longest available up to 90 days). The secondary outcomes will be receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (longest available up to 30 days). We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analyses will be conducted examining key populations including immunocompromised hosts. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by excluding those studies with high risk of bias and different etiologies of acute respiratory failure. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: This study will help to guide clinical decision-making when caring for adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing noninvasive oxygenation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Endogenous ribosomal frameshift signals operate as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast,"Although first discovered in viruses, previous studies have identified operational −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 RF) signals in eukaryotic genomic sequences, and suggested a role in mRNA stability. Here, four yeast −1 RF signals are shown to promote significant mRNA destabilization through the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD), and genetic evidence is presented suggesting that they may also operate through the no-go decay pathway (NGD) as well. Yeast EST2 mRNA is highly unstable and contains up to five −1 RF signals. Ablation of the −1 RF signals or of NMD stabilizes this mRNA, and changes in −1 RF efficiency have opposing effects on the steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA. These results demonstrate that endogenous −1 RF signals function as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast. Consistent with current evolutionary theory, phylogenetic analyses suggest that −1 RF signals are rapidly evolving cis-acting regulatory elements. Identification of high confidence −1 RF signals in ∼10% of genes in all eukaryotic genomes surveyed suggests that −1 RF is a broadly used post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression.",0,"Endogenous ribosomal frameshift signals operate as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast Although first discovered in viruses, previous studies have identified operational −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 RF) signals in eukaryotic genomic sequences, and suggested a role in mRNA stability.

Serological and genotypic characterization of group a rotavirus reassortants from diarrheic calves born to dams vaccinated against rotavirus(),"Two strains of bovine rotavirus (BRV), designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff-1 (NS-1) and NS-2, were isolated from 2 neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches where dams had been vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing group A BRV strain Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCDV)-Lincoln (P1:G6). Nothern blot by hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B641 (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain BRV strain B223 (P11:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between strains B641 and B223. Taken together these results indicated that a naturally-occurring group A BRV reassortant with a P gene different from the vaccine virus was responsible for the diarrheal syndrome observed on both ranches. Results from this study also indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segments 5 among group A BRV infecting cattle.",0,"Serological and genotypic characterization of group a rotavirus reassortants from diarrheic calves born to dams vaccinated against rotavirus() Two strains of bovine rotavirus (BRV), designated strain Nebraska Scottsbluff-1 (NS-1) and NS-2, were isolated from 2 neighboring cow-calf beef cattle ranches where dams had been vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing group A BRV strain Neonatal Calf Diarrhea Virus (NCDV)-Lincoln (P1:G6).

Temporal Anomalies in Immunological Gene Expression in a Time Series of Wild Mice: Signature of an Epidemic?,"Although the ecological importance of coinfection is increasingly recognized, analyses of microbial pathogen dynamics in wildlife usually focus on an ad hoc subset of the species present due to technological limitations on detection. Here we demonstrate the use of expression profiles for immunological genes (pattern recognition receptors, cytokines and transcription factors) as a means to identify, without preconception, the likelihood of important acute microbial infections in wildlife. Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with “normal” expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection. The form of survey described here, combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles, could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized, ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations.",0,"Temporal Anomalies in Immunological Gene Expression in a Time Series of Wild Mice: Signature of an Epidemic?

Accelerating skin wound healing by M-CSF through generating SSEA-1 and -3 stem cells in the injured sites,"Wound healing is a complicated process requiring the collaborative efforts of different cell lineages. Our recent studies have found that one subset of hematopoietic cells can be induced to dedifferentiate into multipotent stem cells by means of a proliferating fibroblast releasable factor, M-CSF. Understanding the importance of stem cells on skin wound healing, here we evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF on skin wound healing. In an in vivo mouse skin excisional wound model, we found that SSEA-positive stem cells were present in wounded but not normal skin. After isolating skin cells from either normal or wounded skin by collagenase digestion, and analyzing the SSEA-1 positive cells by flow cytometry, we found a significant increase in the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin. Topical application of M-CSF in skin wounds accelerated healing remarkably, while application of M-CSF-neutralizing antibody slowed wound healing. Furthermore, injection of EGFP-labeled hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells generated from M-CSF treated splenocytes resulted in EGFP-labeled cells being enriched in the skin wound site and further differentiated into functional organ-specific cells. Together, these data demonstrated that M-CSF makes a significant contribution to the healing process by inducing hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation into stem cells.",0,"Accelerating skin wound healing by M-CSF through generating SSEA-1 and -3 stem cells in the injured sites Wound healing is a complicated process requiring the collaborative efforts of different cell lineages.

Experimental and Computational Observations of Immunogenic Cobalt Porphyrin Lipid Bilayers: Nanodomain-Enhanced Antigen Association,"Cobalt porphyrin phospholipid (CoPoP) can incorporate within bilayers to enable non-covalent surface-display of antigens on liposomes by mixing with proteins bearing a polyhistidine tag (his-tag); however, the mechanisms for how this occurs are poorly understood. These were investigated using the his-tagged model antigen Pfs25, a protein antigen candidate for malaria transmission-blocking vaccines. Pfs25 was found to associate with the small molecule aquocobalamin, a form of vitamin B12 and a cobalt-containing corrin macrocycle, but without particle formation, enabling comparative assessment. Relative to CoPoP liposomes, binding and serum stability studies indicated a weaker association of Pfs25 to aquocobalamin or cobalt nitrilotriacetic acid (Co-NTA) liposomes, which have cobalt displayed in the aqueous phase on lipid headgroups. Antigen internalization by macrophages was enhanced with Pfs25 bound to CoPoP liposomes. Immunization in mice with Pfs25 bound to CoPoP liposomes elicited antibodies that recognized ookinetes and showed transmission-reducing activity. To explore the physical mechanisms involved, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bilayers containing phospholipid, cholesterol, as well as either CoPoP or NTA-functionalized lipids. The results show that the CoPoP-containing bilayer creates nanodomains that allow access for a limited but sufficient amount of water molecules that could be replaced by his-tags due to their favorable free energy properties allowing for stabilization. The position of the metal center within the NTA liposomes was much more exposed to the aqueous environment, which could explain its limited capacity for stabilizing Pfs25. This study illustrates the impact of CoPoP-induced antigen particleization in enhancing vaccine efficacy, and provides molecular insights into the CoPoP bilayer properties that enable this.",0,"Experimental and Computational Observations of Immunogenic Cobalt Porphyrin Lipid Bilayers: Nanodomain-Enhanced Antigen Association Cobalt porphyrin phospholipid (CoPoP) can incorporate within bilayers to enable non-covalent surface-display of antigens on liposomes by mixing with proteins bearing a polyhistidine tag (his-tag); however, the mechanisms for how this occurs are poorly understood.

Transmission Dynamics and Prospects for the Elimination of Canine Rabies,"Rabies has been eliminated from domestic dog populations in Western Europe and North America, but continues to kill many thousands of people throughout Africa and Asia every year. A quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics in domestic dog populations provides critical information to assess whether global elimination of canine rabies is possible. We report extensive observations of individual rabid animals in Tanzania and generate a uniquely detailed analysis of transmission biology, which explains important epidemiological features, including the level of variation in epidemic trajectories. We found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R(0), is very low in our study area in rural Africa (∼1.2) and throughout its historic global range (<2). This finding provides strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine rabies by vaccination, even near wildlife areas with large wild carnivore populations. However, we show that rapid turnover of domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful control in developing countries, thus regular pulse vaccinations will be required to maintain population-level immunity between campaigns. Nonetheless our analyses suggest that with sustained, international commitment, global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is a realistic goal.",0,"Transmission Dynamics and Prospects for the Elimination of Canine Rabies Rabies has been eliminated from domestic dog populations in Western Europe and North America, but continues to kill many thousands of people throughout Africa and Asia every year.

Computational evaluation of anticipated PE_PGRS39 protein involvement in host–pathogen interplay and its integration into vaccine development,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year, which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen. Its success depends on its interaction with the host and its ability to regulate the host’s immune system for its own survival. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv (Mtb) proteome consists of unique PE_PGRS family proteins, which present a significant role in bacterial pathogenesis over the past years. Earlier evidence suggests that some PE_PGRS proteins display fibronectin-binding activity. In this manuscript, computational characterization of the PE_PGRS39 protein has indicated something peculiar about this protein. Investigation showed that PE_PGRS39 is an extracellular protein that, instead of acting as fibronectin-binding protein, might mimic fibronectin which binds to alpha-5 beta-1 (α5β1) integrin. PE_PGRS39 protein additionally turned into proven pieces of evidence to have motifs such as DXXG and GGXGXD and PXXP that bind with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), calcium, and host Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, respectively, in conjunction with RGD-integrin binding. These interactions designate the direct role of PE_PGRS39 in bacterial pathogenesis via cell adhesion and signaling. Additionally, the analysis showed that PE_PGRS39 is an antigenic protein and epitope prediction provided functional regions of the protein that trigger a cellular immune response facilitated by T or B cells. Further, an experimental analysis could also open up new avenues for developing novel drugs by targeting signaling motifs or novel vaccines using functional epitopes that could evoke an immune response in the host.",0,"Computational evaluation of anticipated PE_PGRS39 protein involvement in host–pathogen interplay and its integration into vaccine development Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year, which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen.

Establishing the inter-rater reliability of spinal cord damage manual measurement using magnetic resonance imaging,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVES: To establish the inter-rater reliability in the quantitative evaluation of spinal cord damage following cervical incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used to perform manual measurements of the cranial and caudal boundaries of edema, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume in 10 participants with cervical incomplete SCI. SETTING: Academic university setting. METHODS: Structural MRIs of 10 participants with SCI were collected from Northwestern University’s Neuromuscular Imaging and Research Lab. All manual measures were performed using OsiriX (Pixmeo Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine inter-rater reliability across seven raters of varying experience. RESULTS: High-to-excellent inter-rater reliability was found for all measures. ICC values for cranial/caudal levels of involvement, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume were 0.99, 0.98, 0.90, 0.84, and 0.93, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Manual MRI measures of spinal cord damage are reliable between raters. Researchers and clinicians may confidently utilize manual MRI measures to quantify cord damage.

Understanding Mental Health in the Context of Adolescent Pregnancy and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review Identifying a Critical Evidence Gap,"Adolescent (10–19 years) mental health remains an overlooked global health issue. Rates of adolescent pregnancy within sub-Saharan Africa are some of the highest in the world and occur at the epicentre of the global HIV epidemic. Both experiencing adolescent pregnancy and living with HIV have been found to be associated with adverse mental health outcomes, when investigated separately. Poor mental health may have implications for both parent and child. The literature regarding mental health within groups experiencing both HIV and adolescent pregnancy is yet to be summarised. This systematic review sought to identify (1) the prevalence/occurrence of common mental disorder amongst adolescents who are living with HIV and have experienced pregnancy, (inclusive of adolescent fathers) in sub-Saharan Africa (2) risk and protective factors for common mental disorder among this group, and (3) interventions (prevention/treatment) for common mental disorder among this group. A systematic search of electronic databases using pre-defined search terms, supplemented by hand-searching, was undertaken in September 2020. One author and an independent researcher completed a title and abstract screening of results from the search. A full-text search of all seemingly relevant manuscripts (both quantitative and qualitative) was undertaken and data extracted using pre-determined criteria. A narrative synthesis of included studies is provided. Quality and risk of bias within included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A systematic keyword search of databases and follow-up hand searching identified 2287 unique records. Of these, thirty-eight full-text quantitative records and seven full-text qualitative records were assessed for eligibility. No qualitative records met the eligibility criteria for inclusion within the review. One quantitative record was identified for inclusion. This study reported on depressive symptomology amongst 14 pregnant adolescents living with HIV in Kenya, identifying a prevalence of 92.9%. This included study did not meet the high methodological quality of this review. No studies were identified reporting on risk and protective factors for common mental disorder, and no studies were found identifying any specific interventions for common mental disorder for this group, either for prevention or for treatment. The limited data identified within this review provides no good quality evidence relating to the prevalence of common mental disorder among adolescents living with HIV who have experienced pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. No data was available relating to risk and protective factors or interventions for psychological distress amongst this group. This systematic review identifies a need for rigorous evidence regarding the mental health of pregnant and parenting adolescents living with HIV, and calls for granular interrogation of existing data to further our understanding of the needs of this group. The absence of research on this topic (both quantitative and qualitative) is a critical evidence gap, limiting evidence-based policy and programming responses, as well as regional development opportunities.",0,"Understanding Mental Health in the Context of Adolescent Pregnancy and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review Identifying a Critical Evidence Gap Adolescent (10–19 years) mental health remains an overlooked global health issue.

mTOR Inhibitors as Radiosensitizers in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms,"Peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) has evolved as an important second-line treatment option in the management of inoperable and metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). Though high radiation doses can be delivered to the tumors, complete remission is still rare. Radiosensitization prior to PRRT is therefore considered to be a promising strategy to improve the treatment effect. In this study, effect and mechanism of mTOR inhibitors were investigated in a comprehensive panel of five NEN cell lines (BON, QGP-1, LCC-18, H727, UMC-11), employing assays for cellular proliferation, clonogenic survival, cell cycle modification and signaling. mTOR inhibition lead to growth arrest with a biphasic concentration-response pattern: a partial response at approximately 1 nM and full response at micromolar concentrations (8–48 µM). All cell lines demonstrated elevated p70S6K phosphorylation yet also increased phosphorylation of counterregulatory Akt. The pulmonary NEN cell line UMC-11 showed the lowest induction of phospho-Akt and strongest growth arrest by mTOR inhibitors. Radiation sensitivity of the cells (50% reduction versus control) was found to range between 4 and 8 Gy. Further, mTOR inhibition was employed together with irradiation to evaluate radiosensitizing effects of this combination treatment. mTOR inhibition was found to radiosensitize all five NEN cells in an additive manner with a moderate overall effect. The radiation-induced G2/M arrest was diminished under combination treatment, leading to an increased G1 arrest. Further investigation involving a suitable animal model as well as radioligand application such as (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC will have to demonstrate the full potential of this strategy for radiosensitization in NEN.",0,"mTOR Inhibitors as Radiosensitizers in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) has evolved as an important second-line treatment option in the management of inoperable and metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN).

Renewed Global Partnerships and Redesigned Roadmaps for Rabies Prevention and Control,"Canine rabies, responsible for most human rabies deaths, is a serious global public health concern. This zoonosis is entirely preventable, but by focusing solely upon rabies prevention in humans, this “incurable wound” persists at high costs. Although preventing human deaths through canine rabies elimination is feasible, dog rabies control is often neglected, because dogs are not considered typical economic commodities by the animal health sector. Here, we demonstrate that the responsibility of managing rabies falls upon multiple sectors, that a truly integrated approach is the key to rabies elimination, and that considerable progress has been made to this effect. Achievements include the construction of global rabies networks and organizational partnerships; development of road maps, operational toolkits, and a blueprint for rabies prevention and control; and opportunities for scaling up and replication of successful programs. Progress must continue towards overcoming the remaining challenges preventing the ultimate goal of rabies elimination.",0,"Renewed Global Partnerships and Redesigned Roadmaps for Rabies Prevention and Control Canine rabies, responsible for most human rabies deaths, is a serious global public health concern.

Does the Type of Exposure to Workplace Violence Matter to Nurses’ Mental Health?,"Workplace violence is a prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, particularly among nursing professionals. Exposure to workplace violence may be direct through firsthand involvement, indirect through secondhand witnessing, or both. Even though implications for victims of workplace violence have been well-studied, less is known about the various types of exposure and their effects on nurse mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of workplace-violence exposure types on the mental health of nurses, while accounting for the intensity of the incident/s. This study employs an exploratory correlational design with survey methods. Nurses from British Columbia (BC), Canada, were invited by the provincial nurses’ union to complete an electronic survey in Fall 2019. A total of 2958 responses from direct-care nurses in acute-care settings were analyzed using logistic regression. The results showed that mental-health problems increased with cumulative exposure; even though nurses with solely indirect exposure to workplace violence did not report greater mental-health problems, those experiencing solely direct exposure, or both direct and indirect exposure, were two to four times more likely to report high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and burnout compared to their counterparts with no exposure. There is an urgent need for better mental-health support, prevention policies and practices that take into account the type of workplace-violence exposure.",0,"Does the Type of Exposure to Workplace Violence Matter to Nurses’ Mental Health?

Reducing mortality in sepsis: new directions,"Considerable progress has been made in the past few years in the development of therapeutic interventions that can reduce mortality in sepsis. However, encouraging physicians to put the results of new studies into practice is not always simple. A roundtable was thus convened to provide guidance for clinicians on the integration and implementation of new interventions into the intensive care unit (ICU). Five topics were selected that have been shown in randomized, controlled trials to reduce mortality: limiting the tidal volume in acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, early goal-directed therapy, use of drotrecogin alfa (activated), use of moderate doses of steroids, and tight control of blood sugar. One of the principal investigators for each study was invited to participate in the roundtable. The discussions and questions that followed the presentation of data by each panel member enabled a consensus recommendation to be derived regarding when each intervention should be used. Each new intervention has a place in the management of patients with sepsis. Furthermore, and importantly, the therapies are not mutually exclusive; many patients will need a combination of several approaches – an 'ICU package'. The present article provides guidelines from experts in the field on optimal patient selection and timing for each intervention, and provides advice on how to integrate new therapies into ICU practice, including protocol development, so that mortality rates from this disease process can be reduced.",0,"Reducing mortality in sepsis: new directions Considerable progress has been made in the past few years in the development of therapeutic interventions that can reduce mortality in sepsis.

"Volatile Organic Compounds in Exhaled Breath as Fingerprints of Lung Cancer, Asthma and COPD","Lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are inflammatory diseases that have risen worldwide, posing a major public health issue, encompassing not only physical and psychological morbidity and mortality, but also incurring significant societal costs. The leading cause of death worldwide by cancer is that of the lung, which, in large part, is a result of the disease often not being detected until a late stage. Although COPD and asthma are conditions with considerably lower mortality, they are extremely distressful to people and involve high healthcare overheads. Moreover, for these diseases, diagnostic methods are not only costly but are also invasive, thereby adding to people’s stress. It has been appreciated for many decades that the analysis of trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath could potentially provide cheaper, rapid, and non-invasive screening procedures to diagnose and monitor the above diseases of the lung. However, after decades of research associated with breath biomarker discovery, no breath VOC tests are clinically available. Reasons for this include the little consensus as to which breath volatiles (or pattern of volatiles) can be used to discriminate people with lung diseases, and our limited understanding of the biological origin of the identified VOCs. Lung disease diagnosis using breath VOCs is challenging. Nevertheless, the numerous studies of breath volatiles and lung disease provide guidance as to what volatiles need further investigation for use in differential diagnosis, highlight the urgent need for non-invasive clinical breath tests, illustrate the way forward for future studies, and provide significant guidance to achieve the goal of developing non-invasive diagnostic tests for lung disease. This review provides an overview of these issues from evaluating key studies that have been undertaken in the years 2010–2019, in order to present objective and comprehensive updated information that presents the progress that has been made in this field. The potential of this approach is highlighted, while strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are discussed. This review will be of interest to chemists, biologists, medical doctors and researchers involved in the development of analytical instruments for breath diagnosis.",0,"Volatile Organic Compounds in Exhaled Breath as Fingerprints of Lung Cancer, Asthma and COPD Lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are inflammatory diseases that have risen worldwide, posing a major public health issue, encompassing not only physical and psychological morbidity and mortality, but also incurring significant societal costs.

“I just wear it and I become normal”: a qualitative study of Tanzanian women’s experiences with long-term vaginal pessary use for stress urinary incontinence,"INTRODUCTION: Previous research has shown that vaginal pessaries are a cost-effective treatment for women worldwide suffering from stress urinary incontinence. However, little is known about African women’s experiences with vaginal pessary use. The aim of this study was to understand the experiences of vaginal pessary use among Tanzanian women who had received long-term pessary treatment for stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: 15 semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted over a 2-month period in 2019 with Tanzanian women living in the Kilimanjaro Region who suffered from stress urinary incontinence and who had been using a pessary for at least 18 months. The interview transcripts were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The primary motivation for seeking treatment were discomfort from symptoms, social consequences and low quality of life. Perceived benefits from pessary use included improved quality of life with reacquired abilities to perform daily activities, participate in social gatherings, feeling symptom relief and improved sexual relations. Further, some women saw pessary treatment as superior to other locally available treatment options. Perceived barriers for pessary use included shame, husband’s disapproval, limited access to treatment and lack of knowledge among the women as well as healthcare personnel. CONCLUSION: Vaginal pessaries are well-perceived as a long-term treatment method among Tanzanian women suffering from stress urinary incontinence. This method may have potential to be implemented large scale in Tanzania if combined with basic health education.",0,"“I just wear it and I become normal”: a qualitative study of Tanzanian women’s experiences with long-term vaginal pessary use for stress urinary incontinence INTRODUCTION: Previous research has shown that vaginal pessaries are a cost-effective treatment for women worldwide suffering from stress urinary incontinence.

RESULTS: The primary motivation for seeking treatment were discomfort from symptoms, social consequences and low quality of life. Perceived benefits from pessary use included improved quality of life with reacquired abilities to perform daily activities, participate in social gatherings, feeling symptom relief and improved sexual relations. Further, some women saw pessary treatment as superior to other locally available treatment options. Perceived barriers for pessary use included shame, husband’s disapproval, limited access to treatment and lack of knowledge among the women as well as healthcare personnel. CONCLUSION: Vaginal pessaries are well-perceived as a long-term treatment method among Tanzanian women suffering from stress urinary incontinence. This method may have potential to be implemented large scale in Tanzania if combined with basic health education.",i just wear it and i become normal a qualitative study of tanzanian womens experiences with longterm vaginal pessary use for stress urinary incontinence introduction previous research has shown that vaginal pessaries are a costeffective treatment for women worldwide suffering from stress urinary incontinence however little is known about african womens experiences with vaginal pessary use the aim of this study was to understand the experiences of vaginal pessary use among tanzanian women who had received longterm pessary treatment for stress urinary incontinence methods 15 semistructured individual interviews were conducted over a 2month period in 2019 with tanzanian women living in the kilimanjaro region who suffered from stress urinary incontinence and who had been using a pessary for at least 18 months the interview transcripts were analysed using qualitative content analysis results the primary motivation for seeking treatment were discomfort from symptoms social consequences and low quality of life perceived benefits from pessary use included improved quality of life with reacquired abilities to perform daily activities participate in social gatherings feeling symptom relief and improved sexual relations further some women saw pessary treatment as superior to other locally available treatment options perceived barriers for pessary use included shame husbands disapproval limited access to treatment and lack of knowledge among the women as well as healthcare personnel conclusion vaginal pessaries are wellperceived as a longterm treatment method among tanzanian women suffering from stress urinary incontinence this method may have potential to be implemented large scale in tanzania if combined with basic health education,1
Outcomes after pneumonectomy versus limited lung resection in adults with traumatic lung injury,"Pneumonectomy after traumatic lung injury (TLI) is associated with shock, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventual right ventricular failure. Historically, trauma pneumonectomy (TP) mortality rates ranged between 53 and 100%. It is unclear if contemporary mortality rates have improved. Therefore, we evaluated outcomes associated with TP and limited lung resections (LLR) (i.e., lobectomy and segmentectomy) and aimed to identify predictors of mortality, hypothesizing that TP is associated with greater mortality versus LLR. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2016) and performed a multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent predictors of mortality in TLI patients undergoing TP versus LLR. TLI occurred in 287,276 patients. Of these, 889 required lung resection with 758 (85.3%) undergoing LLR and 131 (14.7%) undergoing TP. Patients undergoing TP had a higher median injury severity score (26.0 vs. 24.5, p = 0.03) but no difference in initial median systolic blood pressure (109 vs. 107 mmHg, p = 0.92) compared to LLR. Mortality was significantly higher for TP compared to LLR (64.9% vs 27.2%, p < 0.001). The strongest independent predictor for mortality was undergoing TP versus LLR (OR 4.89, CI 3.18–7.54, p < 0.001). TP continues to be associated with a higher mortality compared to LLR. Furthermore, TP is independently associated with a fivefold increased risk of mortality compared to LLR. Future investigations should focus on identifying parameters or treatment modalities that improve survivability after TP. We recommend that surgeons reserve TP as a last-resort management given the continued high morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure.",0,"Outcomes after pneumonectomy versus limited lung resection in adults with traumatic lung injury Pneumonectomy after traumatic lung injury (TLI) is associated with shock, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventual right ventricular failure.

"1 Viruses, virulence and pathogenicity","Pathogenicity is a complex process with stringent requirements of both the host cell and the infecting virion. Among these requirements are a port of entry into host cells, a means of replication for the virus, and a means by which infection damages host cells. Damage to the host can result from multiple mechanisms including transformation, suppression of cellular metabolism, apoptosis, autoimmune responses directed against infected or uninfected tissues, or by molecular mimicry. In the attempt to identify new associations between viral infection and disease, investigators should be mindful that variable host factors as well as viral infection may be required for pathogenesis. Efforts to associate specific viral infections with specific diseases may be obscured by final common pathways through which multiple agents damage host cells in similar ways.",0,"1 Viruses, virulence and pathogenicity Pathogenicity is a complex process with stringent requirements of both the host cell and the infecting virion.

Insights From Analysis of Human Antigen-Specific Memory B Cell Repertoires,"Memory B cells that are generated during an infection or following vaccination act as sentinels to guard against future infections. Upon repeat antigen exposure memory B cells differentiate into new antibody-secreting plasma cells to provide rapid and sustained protection. Some pathogens evade or suppress the humoral immune system, or induce memory B cells with a diminished ability to differentiate into new plasma cells. This leaves the host vulnerable to chronic or recurrent infections. Single cell approaches coupled with next generation antibody gene sequencing facilitate a detailed analysis of the pathogen-specific memory B cell repertoire. Monoclonal antibodies that are generated from antibody gene sequences allow a functional analysis of the repertoire. This review discusses what has been learned thus far from analysis of diverse pathogen-specific memory B cell compartments and describes major differences in their repertoires. Such information may illuminate ways to advance the goal of improving vaccine and therapeutic antibody design.",0,"Insights From Analysis of Human Antigen-Specific Memory B Cell Repertoires Memory B cells that are generated during an infection or following vaccination act as sentinels to guard against future infections.

Antibody-based therapeutic interventions: possible strategy to counter chikungunya viral infection,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted disease that belongs to the genus Alphaviruses, has been emerged as an epidemic threat over the last two decades, and the recent co-emergence of this virus along with other circulating arboviruses and comorbidities has influenced atypical mortality rate up to 10%. Genetic variation in the virus has resulted in its adaptability towards the new vector Aedes albopictus other than Aedes aegypti, which has widen the horizon of distribution towards non-tropical and non-endemic areas. As of now, no licensed vaccines or therapies are available against CHIKV; the treatment regimens for CHIKV are mostly symptomatic, based on the clinical manifestations. Development of small molecule drugs and neutralizing antibodies are potential alternatives of worth investigating until an efficient or safe vaccine is approved. Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in antiviral immunity, and their presence is a hallmark of viral infection. In this review, we describe prospects for effective vaccines and highlight importance of neutralizing antibody-based therapeutic and prophylactic applications to combat CHIKV infections. We further discuss about the progress made towards CHIKV therapeutic interventions as well as challenges and limitation associated with the vaccine development.

"Another case of “European hantavirus pulmonary syndrome” with severe lung, prior to kidney, involvement, and diagnosed by viral inclusions in lung macrophages","Puumala virus (PUUV) is considered a classic Old World etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). HFRS is considered to be distinct from hantavirus (cardio-)pulmonary syndrome (HPS or HCPS), described in the New World.

Development of in vitro and in vivo rabies virus neutralization assays based on a high-titer pseudovirus system,"Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility; however the low titer of these viruses substantially limits their wider applications. We developed a highly efficient pseudovirus production system capable of yielding 100 times more rabies pseudovirus than the traditional method. Employing the high-titer pseudoviruses, we have developed robust in vitro and in vivo neutralization assays for the evaluation of rabies vaccine, which traditionally relies on live-virus based assays. Compared with current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), our in vitro pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) is much less labor-intensive while demonstrating better reproducibility. Moreover, the in vivo PBNA assay was also found to be superior to the live virus based assay. Following intravenous administration, the pseudovirus effectively infected the mice, with dynamic viral distributions being sequentially observed in spleen, liver and brain. Furthermore, data from in vivo PBNA showed great agreement with those generated from the live virus model but with the experimental time significantly reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days. Taken together, the effective pseudovirus production system facilitated the development of novel PBNA assays which could replace live virus-based traditional assays due to its safety, rapidity, reproducibility and high throughput capacity.",0,"Development of in vitro and in vivo rabies virus neutralization assays based on a high-titer pseudovirus system Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility; however the low titer of these viruses substantially limits their wider applications.

Microarrays as Research Tools and Diagnostic Devices,"Molecular diagnostics comprises a main analytical division in clinical laboratory diagnostics. The analysis of RNA or DNA helps to diagnose infectious diseases and identify genetic determined disorders or even cancer. Starting from mono-parametric tests within the last years, technologies have evolved that allow for the detection of many parameters in parallel, e.g., by using multiplex nucleic acid amplification techniques, microarrays, or next-generation sequencing technologies. The introduction of closed-tube systems as well as lab-on-a-chip devices further resulted in a higher automation degree with a reduced contamination risk. These applications complement or even stepwise replace classical methods in clinical microbiology like virus cultures, resistance determination, microscopic and metabolic analyses, as well as biochemical or immunohistochemical assays. In addition, novel diagnostic markers appear, like noncoding RNAs and miRNAs providing additional room for novel biomarkers. This article provides an overview of microarrays as diagnostics devices and research tools. Introduced in 1995 for transcription analysis, microarrays are used today to detect several different biomolecules like DNA, RNA, miRNA, and proteins among others.

Mixed-methods economic evaluation of the implementation of tobacco treatment programs in National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers,"BACKGROUND: The Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) was launched in 2017 as a part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot program to assist NCI-designated cancer centers in developing tobacco treatment programs for oncology patients. Participating centers have implemented varied evidence-based programs that fit their institutional resources and needs, offering a wide range of services including in-person and telephone-based counseling, point of care, interactive voice response systems, referral to the quitline, text- and web-based services, and medications. METHODS: We used a mixed methods comparative case study design to evaluate system-level implementation costs across 15 C3I-funded cancer centers that reported for at least one 6-month period between July 2018 and June 2020. We analyzed operating costs by resource category (e.g., personnel, medications) concurrently with transcripts from semi-structured key-informant interviews conducted during site visits. Personnel salary costs were estimated using Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data adjusted for area and occupation, and non-wage benefits. Qualitative findings provided additional information on intangible resources and contextual factors related to implementation costs. RESULTS: Median total monthly operating costs across funded centers were $11,045 (range: $5129–$20,751). The largest median operating cost category was personnel ($10,307; range: $4122–$19,794), with the highest personnel costs attributable to the provision of in-person program services. Monthly (non-zero) cost ranges for other categories were medications ($17–$573), materials ($6–$435), training ($96–$516), technology ($171–$2759), and equipment ($10–$620). Median cost-per-participant was $466 (range: $70–$2093) and cost-per-quit was $2688 (range: $330–$9628), with sites offering different combinations of program components, ranging from individually-delivered in-person counseling only to one program that offered all components. Site interviews provided context for understanding variations in program components and their cost implications. CONCLUSIONS: Among most centers that have progressed in tobacco treatment program implementation, cost-per-quit was modest relative to other prevention interventions. Although select centers have achieved similar average costs by offering program components of various levels of intensity, they have varied widely in program reach and effectiveness. Evaluating implementation costs of such programs alongside reach and effectiveness is necessary to provide decision makers in oncology settings with the important additional information needed to optimize resource allocation when establishing tobacco treatment programs.",0,"Mixed-methods economic evaluation of the implementation of tobacco treatment programs in National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers BACKGROUND: The Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) was launched in 2017 as a part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot program to assist NCI-designated cancer centers in developing tobacco treatment programs for oncology patients.

Combined Vision and Hearing Difficulties Results in Higher Levels of Depression and Chronic Anxiety: Data From a Large Sample of Spanish Adults,"OBJECTIVE: Individually, vision and hearing impairments have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression. We investigated the effect of dual sensory impairment (difficulty seeing and hearing) in a large representative sample of Spanish adults. METHODS: Data from a total of 23,089 adults (age range: 15–103 years, 45.9% men) from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 were analyzed. Self-reported difficulty of seeing and hearing (exposures), and depression and chronic anxiety (outcomes) were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was assessed for difficulty with vision alone, hearing alone and with difficulty with both, adjusting for gender, age, marital status, living as a couple, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, use of glasses/contact lenses, and hearing aid. RESULTS: Visual difficulty, hearing difficulty, and dual difficulties were all associated with significantly higher odds for depression (ORs 2.367, 2.098, and 3.852, respectively) and for chronic anxiety (ORs 1.983, 1.942, and 3.385, respectively). Dual sensory difficulty was associated with higher odds ratios for depression and anxiety when compared to either impairment alone. CONCLUSION: Dual sensory difficulty is associated with significantly higher odds of anxiety and depression when compared to either vision or hearing difficulty alone. Appropriate interventions are needed to address any reversible causes of vision and hearing as well as anxiety and depression in people in these specific groups.",0,"Combined Vision and Hearing Difficulties Results in Higher Levels of Depression and Chronic Anxiety: Data From a Large Sample of Spanish Adults OBJECTIVE: Individually, vision and hearing impairments have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression.

Periodontal Disease and Senescent Cells: New Players for an Old Oral Health Problem?,"The recent identification of senescent cells in periodontal tissues has the potential to provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of periodontal disease etiology. DNA damage-driven senescence is perhaps one of the most underappreciated delayed consequences of persistent Gram-negative bacterial infection and inflammation. Although the host immune response rapidly protects against bacterial invasion, oxidative stress generated during inflammation can indirectly deteriorate periodontal tissues through the damage to vital cell macromolecules, including DNA. What happens to those healthy cells that reside in this harmful environment? Emerging evidence indicates that cells that survive irreparable genomic damage undergo cellular senescence, a crucial intermediate mechanism connecting DNA damage and the immune response. In this review, we hypothesize that sustained Gram-negative bacterial challenge, chronic inflammation itself, and the constant renewal of damaged tissues create a permissive environment for the abnormal accumulation of senescent cells. Based on emerging data we propose a model in which the dysfunctional presence of senescent cells may aggravate the initial immune reaction against pathogens. Further understanding of the role of senescent cells in periodontal disease pathogenesis may have clinical implications by providing more sophisticated therapeutic strategies to combat tissue destruction.",0,"Periodontal Disease and Senescent Cells: New Players for an Old Oral Health Problem?

Emergence and diversification of a highly invasive chestnut pathogen lineage across southeastern Europe,"Invasive microbial species constitute a major threat to biodiversity, agricultural production and human health. Invasions are often dominated by one or a small number of genotypes, yet the underlying factors driving invasions are poorly understood. The chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica first decimated the North American chestnut, and a more recent outbreak threatens European chestnut stands. To unravel the chestnut blight invasion of southeastern Europe, we sequenced 230 genomes of predominantly European strains. Genotypes outside of the invasion zone showed high levels of diversity with evidence for frequent and ongoing recombination. The invasive lineage emerged from the highly diverse European genotype pool rather than a secondary introduction from Asia or North America. The expansion across southeastern Europe was mostly clonal and is dominated by a single mating type, suggesting a fitness advantage of asexual reproduction. Our findings show how an intermediary, highly diverse bridgehead population gave rise to an invasive, largely clonally expanding pathogen.",0,"Emergence and diversification of a highly invasive chestnut pathogen lineage across southeastern Europe Invasive microbial species constitute a major threat to biodiversity, agricultural production and human health.

Immunological disturbances associated with malarial infection,"Malaria is a reemerging disease in the countries where it was eradicated previously, whereas it is endemic in many countries including tropical countries. In India, malarial infection is on rise due to rapid urbanization and overcrowding in all major metropolitan cities. The incidence of morbidity and mortality due to malaria infection is increasing and could be attributed to drug resistance in strains of malarial parasite. Combining immune modulation strategies with anti-malarial drugs has a beneficial effect in an attempt to improve treatment for malaria. Along with clinical presentation and outcome of this parasitic infection, it is important to understand immunological disturbances associated with biological mechanisms underlying these actions in better understanding of pathogenesis of malarial infection. Immune and inflammatory responses in malarial infection are controlled and co-ordinated by various cytokines and chemokines.

Possible therapeutic effect of orally administered ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in an immunocompetent patient: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Human respiratory syncytial virus usually causes self-limiting upper respiratory infection and occasionally causes pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Respiratory syncytial virus-induced severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome in immunocompetent adults has been rarely described. Unfortunately, optimal treatment has not been established for this potentially fatal condition. We report a case of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome occurring in a previously healthy man successfully treated with orally administered ribavirin. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old previously healthy Korean man presented with cough, dyspnea, and febrile sensation. He had hypoxemia with diffuse ground glass opacity evident on chest radiography, which progressed and required mechanical ventilation. All microbiological tests were negative except multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using respiratory specimen, which was positive for human adenovirus. Under the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, orally administered ribavirin was administered and he recuperated completely without complications.

Non-hydrolyzable Diubiquitin Probes Reveal Linkage-Specific Reactivity of Deubiquitylating Enzymes Mediated by S2 Pockets,"Ubiquitin chains are important post-translational modifications that control a large number of cellular processes. Chains can be formed via different linkages, which determines the type of signal they convey. Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) regulate ubiquitylation status by trimming or removing chains from attached proteins. DUBs can contain several ubiquitin-binding pockets, which confer specificity toward differently linked chains. Most tools for monitoring DUB specificity target binding pockets on opposing sides of the active site; however, some DUBs contain additional pockets. Therefore, reagents targeting additional pockets are essential to fully understand linkage specificity. We report the development of active site-directed probes and fluorogenic substrates, based on non-hydrolyzable diubiquitin, that are equipped with a C-terminal warhead or a fluorogenic activity reporter moiety. We demonstrate that various DUBs in lysates display differential reactivity toward differently linked diubiquitin probes, as exemplified by the proteasome-associated DUB USP14. In addition, OTUD2 and OTUD3 show remarkable linkage-specific reactivity with our diubiquitin-based reagents.",0,"Non-hydrolyzable Diubiquitin Probes Reveal Linkage-Specific Reactivity of Deubiquitylating Enzymes Mediated by S2 Pockets Ubiquitin chains are important post-translational modifications that control a large number of cellular processes.

"Coherence of Influenza Surveillance Data across Different Sources and Age Groups, Beijing, China, 2008-2015","Influenza is active during the winter and spring in the city of Beijing, which has a typical temperate climate with four clear distinct seasons. The clinical and laboratory surveillance data for influenza have been used to construct critical indicators for influenza activities in the community, and previous studies have reported varying degrees of association between laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens and outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in subtropical cities. However, few studies have reported on this issue for cities in temperate regions, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, the mechanism behind age-specific seasonal epidemics remains unresolved, although it has been widely discussed. We utilized a wavelet analysis method to monitor the coherence of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens with the weekly outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in Beijing, China. We first examined the seasonal pattern of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtyped into seasonal A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and pandemic virus A(H1N1) pdm09) and influenza B separately within the period from 2008–2015; then, we detected the coherence of clinical and laboratory surveillance data in this district, specially examining weekly time series of age-specific epidemics of influenza-like illnesses in the whole study period for three age categories (age 0–5, 5–15 and 25–60). We found that influenza A and B were both active in winter but were not always seasonally synchronous in Beijing. Synchronization between age ranges was found in most epidemic peaks from 2008–2015. Our findings suggested that peaks of influenza-like illness in individuals aged 0–5 and 5–15 years consistently appeared ahead of those of adults, implying the possibility that schoolchildren may lead epidemic fluctuations.",0,"Coherence of Influenza Surveillance Data across Different Sources and Age Groups, Beijing, China, 2008-2015 Influenza is active during the winter and spring in the city of Beijing, which has a typical temperate climate with four clear distinct seasons.

The Multifaceted Poliovirus 2A Protease: Regulation of Gene Expression by Picornavirus Proteases,"After entry into animal cells, most viruses hijack essential components involved in gene expression. This is the case of poliovirus, which abrogates cellular translation soon after virus internalization. Abrogation is achieved by cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII by the viral protease 2A. Apart from the interference of poliovirus with cellular protein synthesis, other gene expression steps such as RNA and protein trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm are also altered. Poliovirus 2A(pro) is capable of hydrolyzing components of the nuclear pore, thus preventing an efficient antiviral response by the host cell. Here, we compare in detail poliovirus 2A(pro) with other viral proteins (from picornaviruses and unrelated families) as regard to their activity on key host factors that control gene expression. It is possible that future analyses to determine the cellular proteins targeted by 2A(pro) will uncover other cellular functions ablated by poliovirus infection. Further understanding of the cellular proteins hydrolyzed by 2A(pro) will add further insight into the molecular mechanism by which poliovirus and other viruses interact with the host cell.",0,"The Multifaceted Poliovirus 2A Protease: Regulation of Gene Expression by Picornavirus Proteases After entry into animal cells, most viruses hijack essential components involved in gene expression.

Risk factors for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in mechanically ventilated adults in Peru: a multicenter observational study,"BACKGROUND: Clinical and epidemiological differences between acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that presents at the initiation of mechanical ventilation [MV] (ARDS at MV onset) and that which develops during the course of MV (ARDS after MV onset) are not well understood. We conducted an observational study in five Peruvian ICUs to characterize differences between ARDS at MV onset and after MV onset and identify risk factors for the development of ARDS after MV onset. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure requiring at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation and followed them prospectively during the first 28 days and compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes by ARDS status. RESULTS: We enrolled 1657 participants on MV (mean age 60.0 years, 55% males) of whom 334 (20.2%) had ARDS at MV onset and 180 (10.9%) developed ARDS after MV onset. Average tidal volume at the initiation of MV was 8.7 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for participants with ARDS at MV onset, 8.6 mL/kg PBW for those who developed ARDS after MV onset, and 8.5 mL/kg PBW for those who never developed ARDS (p = 0.23). Overall, 90-day mortality was 56% and 55% for ARDS after MV onset and ARDS at MV onset, respectively, as compared to 46% among those who never developed ARDS (p < 0.01). Adults with ARDS had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those without ARDS (27.3 vs 26.5 kg/m(2), p < 0.01). Higher peak pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.21–1.88), higher mean airway pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13–1.76), and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10–1.50) at MV onset were associated with a higher odds of developing ARDS after MV onset. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of mechanically ventilated patients, 31% of study participants had ARDS at some point during their ICU stay. Optimal lung-protective ventilation was not used in a majority of patients. Patients with ARDS after MV onset had a similar 90-day mortality as those with ARDS at MV onset.

Higher airway pressures at MV onset, higher PEEP, and higher BMI were associated with the development of ARDS after MV onset.",risk factors for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in mechanically ventilated adults in peru a multicenter observational study background clinical and epidemiological differences between acute respiratory distress syndrome ards that presents at the initiation of mechanical ventilation mv ards at mv onset and that which develops during the course of mv ards after mv onset are not well understood we conducted an observational study in five peruvian icus to characterize differences between ards at mv onset and after mv onset and identify risk factors for the development of ards after mv onset methods we consecutively enrolled critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure requiring at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation and followed them prospectively during the first 28 days and compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes by ards status results we enrolled 1657 participants on mv mean age 600 years 55 males of whom 334 202 had ards at mv onset and 180 109 developed ards after mv onset average tidal volume at the initiation of mv was 87 mlkg of predicted body weight pbw for participants with ards at mv onset 86 mlkg pbw for those who developed ards after mv onset and 85 mlkg pbw for those who never developed ards p  023 overall 90day mortality was 56 and 55 for ards after mv onset and ards at mv onset respectively as compared to 46 among those who never developed ards p  001 adults with ards had a higher body mass index bmi than those without ards 273 vs 265 kgm2 p  001 higher peak pressure adjusted interquartile or  151 95 ci 121188 higher mean airway pressure adjusted interquartile or  141 95 ci 113176 and higher positive endexpiratory pressure adjusted interquartile or  129 95 ci 110150 at mv onset were associated with a higher odds of developing ards after mv onset conclusions in this study of mechanically ventilated patients 31 of study participants had ards at some point during their icu stay optimal lungprotective ventilation was not used in a majority of patients patients with ards after mv onset had a similar 90day mortality as those with ards at mv onset higher airway pressures at mv onset higher peep and higher bmi were associated with the development of ards after mv onset,1
Unveiling the Mechanism of Action of 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone on an MRSA/VISA Strain: Membrane and Cell Wall Interactions,"The number of cases of failure in the treatment of infections associated with resistant bacteria is on the rise, due to the decreasing efficacy of current antibiotics. Notably, 7α-Acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (AHR), a diterpene isolated from different Plectranthus species, showed antibacterial activity, namely against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. The high antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity render this natural compound an interesting alternative against resistant bacteria. The aim of this study is to understand the mechanism of action of AHR on MRSA, using the MRSA/Vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) strain CIP 106760, and to study the AHR effect on lipid bilayers and on the cell wall. Although AHR interacted with lipid bilayers, it did not have a significant effect on membrane passive permeability. Alternatively, bacteria treated with this royleanone displayed cell wall disruption, without revealing cell lysis. In conclusion, the results gathered so far point to a yet undescribed mode of action that needs further investigation.",0,"Unveiling the Mechanism of Action of 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone on an MRSA/VISA Strain: Membrane and Cell Wall Interactions The number of cases of failure in the treatment of infections associated with resistant bacteria is on the rise, due to the decreasing efficacy of current antibiotics.

Airway Transmural Pressures in an Airway Tree During Bronchoconstriction in Asthma,"Airway transmural pressure in healthy homogeneous lungs with dilated airways is approximately equal to the difference between intraluminal and pleural pressure. However, bronchoconstriction causes airway narrowing, parenchymal distortion, dynamic hyperinflation, and the emergence of ventilation defects (VDefs) affecting transmural pressure. This study aimed to investigate the changes in transmural pressure caused by bronchoconstriction in a bronchial tree. Transmural pressures before and during bronchoconstriction were estimated using an integrative computational model of bronchoconstriction. Briefly, this model incorporates a 12-generation symmetric bronchial tree, and the Anafi and Wilson model for the individual airways of the tree. Bronchoconstriction lead to the emergence of VDefs and a relative increase in peak transmural pressures of up to 84% compared to baseline. The highest increase in peak transmural pressure occurred in a central airway outside of VDefs, and the lowest increase was 27% in an airway within VDefs illustrating the heterogeneity in peak transmural pressures within a bronchial tree. Mechanisms contributing to the increase in peak transmural pressures include increased regional ventilation and dynamic hyperinflation both leading to increased alveolar pressures compared to baseline. Pressure differences between intraluminal and alveolar pressure increased driven by the increased airway resistance and its contribution to total transmural pressure reached up to 24%. In conclusion, peak transmural pressure in lungs with VDefs during bronchoconstriction can be substantially increased compared to dilated airways in healthy homogeneous lungs and is highly heterogeneous. Further insights will depend on the experimental studies taking these conditions into account.",0,"Airway Transmural Pressures in an Airway Tree During Bronchoconstriction in Asthma Airway transmural pressure in healthy homogeneous lungs with dilated airways is approximately equal to the difference between intraluminal and pleural pressure.

"Compassion fatigue, watching patients suffering and emotional display rules among hospice professionals: a daily diary study","BACKGROUND: Hospice workers are required to regularly use emotional regulation strategies in an attempt to encourage and sustain terminally ill patients and families. Daily emotional regulation in reaction to constantly watching suffering patients may be intensified among those hospice professionals who have high levels of compassion fatigue. The main object of this study was to examine the relationship between daily exposition to seeing patient suffering and daily emotional work, and to assess whether compassion fatigue (secondary traumatic stress and burnout) buffers this relationship. METHODS: We used a diary research design for collecting daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering and emotional work display. Participants filled in a general survey and daily survey over a period of eight consecutive workdays. A total of 39 hospice professionals from two Italian hospices participated in the study. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses demonstrated that daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering was positively related to daily emotional work display after controlling for daily death of patients. Moreover, considering previous levels of compassion fatigue, a buffering effect of high burnout on seeing patients suffering - daily emotional work display relationship was found. CONCLUSIONS: A central finding of our study is that fluctuations in daily witness of patients suffering are positively related to daily use of positive emotional regulations. Further, our results show that burnout buffers this relationship such that hospice professionals with high burnout use more emotional display in days where they recurrently witness patients suffering.",0,"Compassion fatigue, watching patients suffering and emotional display rules among hospice professionals: a daily diary study BACKGROUND: Hospice workers are required to regularly use emotional regulation strategies in an attempt to encourage and sustain terminally ill patients and families.

"Thai Older People’s Willingness (Intention) to Participate in a Care Prevention, Community Group Exercise Program: An Assessment before Implementing an Intervention Trial in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand","Background: Sustainability of a current family-based long-term care model in Thailand has been challenged by demographic aging, and the rising burden of non-communicable diseases and age-related morbidities. In order to overcome these challenges, a community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) service model, including functional training as one of the interventions, was introduced. To increase program uptake and adherence, it is vital to understand the facilitators and barriers for joining this group exercise. Therefore, we aimed to explore the determinants of older adults’ willingness to participate in it. Methods: A total of 1509 participants from an intervention arm of a cluster randomized trial were interviewed with a structured questionnaire. A descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression were applied. Results: More than half of participants (51.4%) were willing to join community-based care prevention, functional training exercise program. Significant associated motivators were being of younger age, female, married, working seniors, original community residents, having (regular and irregular) exercise habits, history of a fall in the last six months, needs for walking aids and secondary caregivers. Conclusion: Our findings highlighted both personal and social factors motivated old people to access health promotion activities. It might help design or implement effective programs to promote healthy aging among community-dwelling seniors in Thailand.

Increased Urinary Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in Renal Transplant Patients with Diabetes,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in the kidney and may be a renoprotective enzyme, since it converts angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7). ACE2 has been detected in urine from patients with chronic kidney disease. We measured urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels in renal transplant patients (age 54 yrs, 65% male, 38% diabetes, n = 100) and healthy controls (age 45 yrs, 26% male, n = 50), and determined factors associated with elevated urinary ACE2 in the patients. Urine from transplant subjects was also assayed for ACE mRNA and protein. No subjects were taking inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Urinary ACE2 levels were significantly higher in transplant patients compared to controls (p = 0.003 for ACE2 activity, and p≤0.001 for ACE2 protein by ELISA or western analysis). Transplant patients with diabetes mellitus had significantly increased urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels compared to non-diabetics (p<0.001), while ACE2 mRNA levels did not differ. Urinary ACE activity and protein were significantly increased in diabetic transplant subjects, while ACE mRNA levels did not differ from non-diabetic subjects. After adjusting for confounding variables, diabetes was significantly associated with urinary ACE2 activity (p = 0.003) and protein levels (p<0.001), while female gender was associated with urinary mRNA levels for both ACE2 and ACE. These data indicate that urinary ACE2 is increased in renal transplant recipients with diabetes, possibly due to increased shedding from tubular cells.

Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype,"The Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell (CRFK) is an immortalised cell line derived from the feline kidney that is utilised for the growth of certain vaccinal viruses. Confusion exists as to whether CRFK are epithelial or mesenchymal in phenotype. The aim of this study was to characterise CRFK cells via immunofluorescence, enzyme cytochemistry, western blotting, RT-qPCR for S100A4 and comparison to primary feline proximal tubular epithelial cells (FPTEC) and feline cortical fibroblasts (FCF). CRFK cells were of fusiform morphology and appeared similar to FCF. CRFK expressed the mesenchymal intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin together with two cell adhesion molecules associated with feline fibroblasts (CD29 and CD44), and lacked expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, myogenic IF desmin and endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF). In addition, CRFK did not demonstrate brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC. S100A4 gene expression, implicated in both neoplastic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, was highly upregulated in CRFK in comparison to the primary feline renal cells. CRFK appear phenotypically similar to fibroblasts, rather than tubular epithelial cells, and may have undergone neoplastic transformation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after extensive passaging. This finding may have potential implications for future research utilising this cell line.",0,"Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype The Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell (CRFK) is an immortalised cell line derived from the feline kidney that is utilised for the growth of certain vaccinal viruses.

PLAN-M; Mycobacteriophage Endolysins Fused to Biodegradable Nanobeads Mitigate Mycobacterial Growth in Liquid and on Surfaces,"The Mycobacteria are a genus of Actinobacteria that include human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). Active TB disease can spread by airborne transmission to healthcare workers and to their community. The HHMI SEA-PHAGES program has contributed to discovering bacteriophages that are able to infect M. smegmatis MC(2) 155, a close relative of M. tuberculosis. This collection of diverse Mycobacteriophages is an excellent resource for trialling bacteriophage-sourced enzymes in novel applications. Herein we measured the ability Mycobacteriophage endolysins to lyse their host strain when functionally fused to biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) nanobeads. PHA nanobeads facilitate both the expression and the application of enzymes to surfaces and have been demonstrated to stabilize a wide array of proteins for practical applications whilst eliminating the challenges of traditional protein purification. We selected two Lysin A and six Lysin B homologs to be functionally fused to the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase C (PhaC). Expression of these constructs resulted in functional lysins displayed on the surface of PHA nanobeads. The lysins thus directionally displayed on nanobeads lysed up to 79% of the M. smegmatis MC(2) 155 population using 80 mg/mL of nanobeads in pure culture. In order to determine whether the nanobeads would be effective as a protective layer in PPE we adapted a fabric-based test and observed a maximum of 1 log loss of the cell population after 5 h of exposure on a textile (91% cell lysis). Lysin B enzymes performed better than the Lysin A enzymes as a protective barrier on textiles surface assays. These results suggest that bacterial endolysins are efficient in their action when displayed on PHA nanobeads and can cause significant population mortality in as little as 45 min. Our results provide the proof-of-principle that Mycobacteriophage endolysins can be used on functionalized nanobeads where they can protect surfaces such as personal protective equipment (PPE) that routinely come into contact with aerosolised bacteria.",0,"PLAN-M; Mycobacteriophage Endolysins Fused to Biodegradable Nanobeads Mitigate Mycobacterial Growth in Liquid and on Surfaces The Mycobacteria are a genus of Actinobacteria that include human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB).

The effect of perceived interracial competition on psychological outcomes,"There remains a dearth of research on causal roles of perceived interracial competition on psychological outcomes. Towards this end, this research experimentally manipulated perceptions of group-level competition between Black and White individuals in the U.S. and tested for effects on negative psychological outcomes. In Study 1 (N = 899), participants assigned to the high interracial competition condition (HRC) reported perceiving more discrimination, behavioral avoidance, intergroup anxiety, and interracial mistrust relative to low interracial competition (LRC) participants. Study 2 –a preregistered replication and extension—specifically recruited similar numbers of only Black and White participants (N = 1,823). Consistent with Study 1, Black and White participants in the HRC condition reported more discrimination, avoidance, anxiety, and mistrust. Main effects for race also emerged: Black participants perceived more interracial competition and negative outcomes. Racial income inequality moderated effects; competition effects were stronger in areas with higher levels of inequality.

Consistent with Study 1, Black and White participants in the HRC condition reported more discrimination, avoidance, anxiety, and mistrust. Main effects for race also emerged: Black participants perceived more interracial competition and negative outcomes. Racial income inequality moderated effects; competition effects were stronger in areas with higher levels of inequality. Implications for theory development are discussed.",the effect of perceived interracial competition on psychological outcomes there remains a dearth of research on causal roles of perceived interracial competition on psychological outcomes towards this end this research experimentally manipulated perceptions of grouplevel competition between black and white individuals in the us and tested for effects on negative psychological outcomes in study 1 n  899 participants assigned to the high interracial competition condition hrc reported perceiving more discrimination behavioral avoidance intergroup anxiety and interracial mistrust relative to low interracial competition lrc participants study 2 a preregistered replication and extensionspecifically recruited similar numbers of only black and white participants n  1823 consistent with study 1 black and white participants in the hrc condition reported more discrimination avoidance anxiety and mistrust main effects for race also emerged black participants perceived more interracial competition and negative outcomes racial income inequality moderated effects competition effects were stronger in areas with higher levels of inequality implications for theory development are discussed,1
Outcome and prognostic factors of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a prospective observational study,"BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) remains a severe disease associated with high rates of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality. The objectives of this study were to assess early risk factors for severe PJP and 90-day mortality, including the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid cytology profiles at diagnosis. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all patients meeting pre-defined diagnostic criteria for PJP admitted at Nantes university hospital, France, from January 2012 to January 2017. Diagnostic criteria for PJP were typical clinical features with microbiological confirmation of P. jirovecii cysts by direct examination or a positive specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Severe PJP was defined as hypoxemic acute respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal oxygen with at least 50% FiO(2), non-invasive ventilation, or MV. RESULTS: Of 2446 respiratory samples investigated during the study period, 514 from 430 patients were positive for P. jirovecii. Of these 430 patients, 107 met criteria for PJP and were included in the study, 53 (49.5%) patients had severe PJP, including 30 who required MV. All patients were immunocompromised with haematological malignancy ranking first (n = 37, 35%), followed by solid organ transplantation (n = 27, 25%), HIV-infection (n = 21, 20%), systemic diseases (n = 13, 12%), solid tumors (n = 12, 11%) and primary immunodeficiency (n = 6, 8%). By multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with severity were older age (OR, 3.36; 95% CI 1.4–8.5; p < 0.05), a P. jirovecii microscopy-positive result from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (OR, 1.3; 95% CI 1.54–9.3; p < 0.05); and absence of a BAL fluid alveolitis profile (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.27–8.8; p < 0.04). The 90-day mortality rate was 27%, increasing to 50% in the severe PJP group. Factors independently associated with 90-day mortality were worse SOFA score on day 1 (OR, 1.05; 95% CI 1.02–1.09; p < 0.001) whereas alveolitis at BAL was protective (OR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.65–0.96; p < 0.05). In the subgroup of HIV-negative patients, similar findings were obtained, then viral co-infection were independently associated with higher 90-day mortality (OR, 1.25; 95% CI 1.02–1.55; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Older age and P. jirovecii oocysts at microscopic examination of BAL were independently associated with severe PJP. Both initial PJP severity as evaluated by the SOFA score and viral co-infection predicted 90-day mortality. Alveolitis at BAL examination was associated with less severe PJP. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying this observation deserves further investigation.",0,"Outcome and prognostic factors of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a prospective observational study BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) remains a severe disease associated with high rates of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality.

Electrical Characterization of Cellulose-Based Membranes towards Pathogen Detection in Water †,"Paper substrates are promising for development of cost-effective and efficient point-of-care biosensors, essential for public healthcare and environmental diagnostics in emergency situations. Most paper-based biosensors rely on the natural capillarity of paper to perform qualitative or semi-quantitative colorimetric detections. To achieve quantification and better sensitivity, technologies combining paper-based substrates and electrical detection are being developed. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of electrical measurements by means of a simple, parallel-plate electrode setup towards the detection of whole-cell bacteria captured in nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. Unlike current electrical sensors, which are mostly integrated, this plug and play system has reusable electrodes and enables simple and fast bacterial detection through impedance measurements. The characterized NC membrane was subjected to (i) a biofunctionalization, (ii) different saline solutions modelling real water samples, and (iii) bacterial suspensions of different concentrations. Bacterial detection was achieved in low conductivity buffers through both resistive and capacitive changes in the sensed medium. To capture Bacillus thuringiensis, the model microorganism used in this work, the endolysin cell-wall binding domain (CBD) of Deep-Blue, a bacteriophage targeting this bacterium, was integrated into the membranes as a recognition bio-interface. This experimental proof-of-concept illustrates the electrical detection of 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) mL(−1) bacteria in low-salinity buffers within 5 min, using a very simple setup. This offers perspectives for affordable pathogen sensors that can easily be reconfigured for different bacteria. Water quality testing is a particularly interesting application since it requires frequent testing, especially in emergency situations.",0,"Electrical Characterization of Cellulose-Based Membranes towards Pathogen Detection in Water † Paper substrates are promising for development of cost-effective and efficient point-of-care biosensors, essential for public healthcare and environmental diagnostics in emergency situations.

Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia and Other Infections in Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The management of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) can be complex and challenging due to the myriad of complications they can experience. The continued use of corticosteroids, in addition to the rise of combination immunosuppressive therapy, has contributed to the ongoing concern for infection. Perhaps the most feared infection in IIM patients is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) given its infrequent occurrence yet high mortality. The field has been, and continues to be, without evidence-based guidelines to help clinicians determine which patients with IIM to prescribe prophylaxis. Herein, we review this literature to provide the clinician with an up-to-date view of infections in IIM. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 5 years, a number of studies have been reported highlighting various infectious complications, which help us better understand their frequency and associated risk factors. In addition, data has been published on the potential harms of PJP prophylaxis, to better inform the risk/benefit of our decision-making. SUMMARY: Infection remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in IIM. A better understanding of which patient subgroups are at risk for particular infections will inform optimal management strategies.",0,"Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia and Other Infections in Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The management of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) can be complex and challenging due to the myriad of complications they can experience.

The Relationship Exploration between Public Migration Attention and Population Migration from a Perspective of Search Query,"Rapid population migration has been viewed as a critical factor impacting urban network construction and regional sustainable development. The supervision and analysis of population migration are necessary for guiding the optimal allocation of urban resources and for attaining the high efficiency development of region. Currently, the explorations of population migration are often restricted by the limitation of data. In the information era, search engines widely collect public attention, implying potential individual actions, and freely provide open, timelier, and large-scope search query data for helping explore regional phenomena and problems. In this paper, we endeavor to explore the possibility of adopting such data to depict population migration. Based on the search query from Baidu search engine, three migration attention indexes (MAIs) are constructed to capture public migration attention in cyber space. Taking three major urban agglomerations in China as case study, we conduct the correlation analysis among the cyber MAIs and population migration in geographical space. Results have shown that external-MAI and local-MAI can positively reflect the population migration inner regions and across regions from a holistic lens and that intercity-MAI can be a helpful supplement for the delineation of specific population flow. Along with the accumulation of cyber search query data, its potential in exploring population migration can be further reinforced.",0,"The Relationship Exploration between Public Migration Attention and Population Migration from a Perspective of Search Query Rapid population migration has been viewed as a critical factor impacting urban network construction and regional sustainable development.

Evaluation of free or liposome-encapsulated ribavirin for antiviral therapy of experimentally induced feline infectious peritonitis,"Ribavirin, either free in aqueous solution or incorporated into liposomes, was evaluated in 50 specific-pathogen-free kittens after experimental challenge exposure with feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv). Ribavirin was administered daily for 10 to 14 days at 16·5 mg kg(−1) bodyweight given per os, intramuscularly or intravenously beginning 18 hours after kittens were challenge-exposed with fipv. All kittens, including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens, succumbed to FIP. Clinical signs of disease were more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened. The clinical efficacy of free ribavirin given intravenously at a reduced dosage (5·5 mg kg(−1) bodyweight) was compared to that of ribavirin incorporated into lecithin-containing liposomes (5 mg kg(−1)) intravenously. Drugs were given once daily for three consecutive days of each week for three weeks, beginning 18 hours after virus challenge exposure. There was no significant difference either in survival rate or severity of disease between kittens given free ribavirin, liposomal ribavirin or saline only. Because of its intrinsic toxicity and low therapeutic index against fipv and its marginal antiviral activities in vivo at maximal doses, ribavirin cannot presently be recommended as primary antiviral chemotherapy against fip.",0,"Evaluation of free or liposome-encapsulated ribavirin for antiviral therapy of experimentally induced feline infectious peritonitis Ribavirin, either free in aqueous solution or incorporated into liposomes, was evaluated in 50 specific-pathogen-free kittens after experimental challenge exposure with feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv).

Neutrophil-derived granule cargoes: paving the way for tumor growth and progression,"Neutrophils are the key cells of our innate immune system mediating host defense via a range of effector functions including phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. For this, they employ an arsenal of anti-microbial cargoes packed in their readily mobilizable granule subsets. Notably, the release of granule content is tightly regulated; however, under certain circumstances, their unregulated release can aggravate tissue damage and could be detrimental to the host. Several constituents of neutrophil granules have also been associated with various inflammatory diseases including cancer. In cancer setting, their excessive release may modulate tissue microenvironment which ultimately leads the way for tumor initiation, growth and metastasis. Neutrophils actively infiltrate within tumor tissues, wherein they show diverse phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. While most studies are focused at understanding the phenotypic heterogeneity of neutrophils, their functional heterogeneity, much of which is likely orchestrated by their granule cargoes, is beginning to emerge. Therefore, a better understanding of neutrophil granules and their cargoes will not only shed light on their diverse role in cancer but will also reveal them as novel therapeutic targets. This review provides an overview on existing knowledge of neutrophil granules and detailed insight into the pathological relevance of their cargoes in cancer.

Protective effects and immunomodulation on piglets infected with rotavirus following resveratrol supplementation,"Rotavirus (RV), belonging to Reoviridae family, is the leading cause of acute severe viral diarrhea in children (under 5 years old) and infant animals worldwide. Although vaccines are commonly used to prevent infection, episodes of diarrhea caused by RV frequently occur. Thus, this study was conducted to determine whether resveratrol had protective effects against RV infection in piglets. Following pretreatment with resveratrol dry suspension through adding into the basal diet for 3 weeks, the piglets were orally challenged with RV. We found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by RV infection. Resveratrol-treatment inhibited the TNF-α production, indicating that the anti-RV activity of resveratrol may be achieved by reducing the inflammatory response. The IFN-γ level was elevated in 10mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group and 30mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group after RV infection. The ratios of CD4+/CD8+ in resveratrol-treated groups were the same as that in mock infected group, suggesting that resveratrol could maintain the immune function in RV-infected piglets. It was found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by RV infection. These results revealed that resveratrol dry suspension could be a new control measure for RV infection.",0,"Protective effects and immunomodulation on piglets infected with rotavirus following resveratrol supplementation Rotavirus (RV), belonging to Reoviridae family, is the leading cause of acute severe viral diarrhea in children (under 5 years old) and infant animals worldwide.

The ratios of CD4+/CD8+ in resveratrol-treated groups were the same as that in mock infected group, suggesting that resveratrol could maintain the immune function in RV-infected piglets. It was found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by RV infection. These results revealed that resveratrol dry suspension could be a new control measure for RV infection.",protective effects and immunomodulation on piglets infected with rotavirus following resveratrol supplementation rotavirus rv belonging to reoviridae family is the leading cause of acute severe viral diarrhea in children under 5 years old and infant animals worldwide although vaccines are commonly used to prevent infection episodes of diarrhea caused by rv frequently occur thus this study was conducted to determine whether resveratrol had protective effects against rv infection in piglets following pretreatment with resveratrol dry suspension through adding into the basal diet for 3 weeks the piglets were orally challenged with rv we found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by rv infection resveratroltreatment inhibited the tnfα production indicating that the antirv activity of resveratrol may be achieved by reducing the inflammatory response the ifnγ level was elevated in 10mgkgd resveratroltreated group and 30mgkgd resveratroltreated group after rv infection the ratios of cd4cd8 in resveratroltreated groups were the same as that in mock infected group suggesting that resveratrol could maintain the immune function in rvinfected piglets it was found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by rv infection these results revealed that resveratrol dry suspension could be a new control measure for rv infection,1
Executive Dysfunction Following Critical Illness: Exploring Risk Factors and Management Options in Geriatric Populations,"Cognitive impairment is a common occurrence that has been shown to occur in over 50 % of patients following critical illness. This impairment occurs across a range of domains including attention, memory, processing speed, and executive dysfunction. In this article, we will discuss the pathophysiology behind cognitive impairment including hypoxemia and cytokines. Secondly, we will describe the risk factors for cognitive impairment including age, length of stay, and delirium. Lastly, we will review emerging data related to the use of cognitive rehabilitation, formation of postintensive care clinics in qualifying patients, and potential neuropharmacologic therapy. While our chapter focuses on cognitive impairment generally, it places a particular emphasis on executive dysfunction, not because impairment occurs solely in this domain but because impairments of an executive nature may be uniquely debilitating.",0,"Executive Dysfunction Following Critical Illness: Exploring Risk Factors and Management Options in Geriatric Populations Cognitive impairment is a common occurrence that has been shown to occur in over 50 % of patients following critical illness.

"Optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life during pregnancy across three continents: a matched cohort study in China, Ghana, and the United States","BACKGROUND: Little is known about how optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life compare across cultures. METHODS: Three samples of pregnant women in their final trimester were recruited from China, Ghana, and the United States (U.S.). Participants completed a survey that included the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R, an optimism/pessimism measure), the Short Form 12 (SF-12, a quality of life measure), and questions addressing health and demographic factors. A three-country set was created for analysis by matching women on age, gestational age at enrollment, and number of previous pregnancies. Anovas with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were used to compare results across the cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to create a model to identify those variables most strongly associated with optimism/pessimism. RESULTS: LOT-R scores varied significantly across cultures in these samples, with Ghanaian pregnant women being the most optimistic and least pessimistic and Chinese pregnant women being the least optimistic overall and the least pessimistic in subscale analysis. Four key variables predicted approximately 20% of the variance in overall optimism scores: country of origin (p = .006), working for money (p = .05); level of education (p = .002), and ever being treated for emotional issues with medication (p < .001). Quality of life scores also varied by country in these samples, with the most pronounced difference occurring in the vitality measure. U.S. pregnant women reported far lower vitality scores than both Chinese and Ghanaian pregnant women in our sample. CONCLUSION: This research raises important questions regarding what it is about country of origin that so strongly influences optimism/pessimism among pregnant women. Further research is warranted exploring underlying conceptualization of optimism/pessimism and health related quality of life across countries.",0,"Optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life during pregnancy across three continents: a matched cohort study in China, Ghana, and the United States BACKGROUND: Little is known about how optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life compare across cultures.

Copper Alloy Touch Surfaces in Healthcare Facilities: An Effective Solution to Prevent Bacterial Spreading,"In the healthcare environment, microorganisms’ cross-transmission between inanimate surfaces and patients or healthcare workers can lead to healthcare-associated infections. A recent interest has grown to create antimicrobial copper touch surfaces, in order to counteract microbial spread in the healthcare environment. For the first time, five French long-term care facilities were at 50% fitted with copper alloys door handles and handrails. Related to the environmental bacterial contamination, 1400 samples were carried out on copper and control surfaces over three years after copper installation. In addition, some copper door handles were taken from the different facilities, and their specific activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was tested in vitro. In comparison to control surfaces, copper door handles and handrails revealed significantly lower contamination levels. This difference was observed in the five long-term care facilities and it persists through the three years of the study. High and extreme levels of bacterial contamination were less frequent on copper surfaces. Although, the antibacterial activity of copper surfaces against MRSA was lowered after three years of regular use, it was still significant as compared to inert control surfaces. Therefore, copper containing surfaces are promising actors in the non-spreading of environmental bacterial contamination in healthcare facilities.",0,"Copper Alloy Touch Surfaces in Healthcare Facilities: An Effective Solution to Prevent Bacterial Spreading In the healthcare environment, microorganisms’ cross-transmission between inanimate surfaces and patients or healthcare workers can lead to healthcare-associated infections.

Macrophage-Mediated Optic Neuritis Induced by Retrograde Axonal Transport of Spike Gene Recombinant Mouse Hepatitis Virus,"Following intracranial inoculation, neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains induce acute inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss in the CNS. Prior studies using recombinant MHV strains that differ only in the spike gene, which encodes a glycoprotein involved in virus-host cell attachment, demonstrated that spike mediates anterograde axonal transport of virus to the spinal cord. A demyelinating MHV strain induces optic neuritis, but whether this is due to retrograde axonal transport of viral particles to the retina, or if it is due to traumatic disruption of retinal ganglion cell axons during intracranial inoculation is not known. Using recombinant isogenic MHV strains, we examined the ability of recombinant MHV to induce optic neuritis by retrograde spread from the brain through the optic nerve into the eye following intracranial inoculation. Recombinant demyelinating MHV induced macrophage infiltration of optic nerves, demyelination and axonal loss whereas optic neuritis and axonal injury were minimal in mice infected with the non-demyelinating MHV strain that differs in the spike gene. Thus, optic neuritis was dependent on a spike glycoprotein-mediated mechanism of viral antigen transport along retinal ganglion cell axons. These data indicate that MHV spreads by retrograde axonal transport to the eye and that targeting spike protein interactions with axonal transport machinery is a potential therapeutic strategy for CNS viral infections and associated diseases.",0,"Macrophage-Mediated Optic Neuritis Induced by Retrograde Axonal Transport of Spike Gene Recombinant Mouse Hepatitis Virus Following intracranial inoculation, neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains induce acute inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss in the CNS.

Exploring Language Learning as a Potential Tool against Cognitive Impairment in Late-Life Depression: Two Meta-Analyses and Suggestions for Future Research,"Late-life depression (LLD) affects about an eighth of community-dwelling seniors. LLD impacts well-being, with loneliness and small social networks being typical. It has also been linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk of developing dementia. Safety and efficacy of pharmacological treatments for LLD have been debated, and cognitive dysfunction often persists even after remission. Various cognitive interventions have been proposed for LLD. Among these, one has received special attention: foreign language learning could serve as a social intervention that simultaneously targets brain structures affected in LLD. Lifelong bilingualism may significantly delay the onset of cognitive impairment symptoms by boosting cognitive reserve. Even late-life foreign language learning without lifelong bilingualism can train cognitive flexibility. It is then counterintuitive that the effects of language learning on LLD have never been examined. In order to create a theoretical basis for further interdisciplinary research, this paper presents a status quo of current work through two meta-analyses investigating cognitive functioning in LLD on the one hand and in senior bilinguals or seniors following a language course on the other hand. While LLD was consistently associated with cognitive dysfunction, inconsistent results were found for bilingualism and language learners.

Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis,INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to demonstrate Interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. IL-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real-time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of two months' treatment course. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. RESULTS: Of all 16 studied patients significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and P = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept which views psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.,0,Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to demonstrate Interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions.

Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus,"Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists. Canine distemper is a multi-host carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). The described cell receptor of CDV is SLAM (CD150). Attachment of CDV hemagglutinin protein (CDV-H) to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein (CDV-F). We investigated whether CDV strains co-evolved in the large, homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits, and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the SLAM binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from Canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families. Using an in vitro assay, we quantified syncytia formation mediated by CDV-H proteins from dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing dog, lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog SLAM than with cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types, but lower values in cells expressing dog SLAM than the values obtained for CDV-H proteins from dog strains. By experimentally changing one amino acid (Y549H) in the CDV-H protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits, thereby confirming its functional importance. A virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog SLAM than cells expressing SLAM of non-dog hosts, which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry. We provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by CDV strains, and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy. These findings extend knowledge on CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.",0,"Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists.

"An Investigation of Healthcare Professionals’ Motivation in Public and Mission Hospitals in Meru County, Kenya","Strengthening health systems in developing countries such as Kenya is required to achieve the third United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of health for all, at all ages. However, Kenya is experiencing a “brain drain” and a critical shortage of healthcare professionals. There is a need to identify the factors that motivate healthcare workers to work in the health sector in rural and marginalized areas. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the factors associated with the level and types of motivation among healthcare professionals in public and mission hospitals in Meru county, Kenya. Data were collected from 24 public and mission hospitals using a self-administered structured questionnaire. A total of 553 healthcare professionals participated in this study; 78.48% from public hospitals and 21.52% from mission hospitals. Hospital ownership was statistically nonsignificant in healthcare professionals’ overall motivation (p > 0.05). The results showed that sociodemographic and work-environment factors explained 29.95% of the variation in overall motivation scores among participants. Findings indicate there are more similarities than disparities among healthcare professionals’ motivation factors, regardless of hospital ownership; therefore, motivation strategies should be developed and applied in both public and private not-for-profit hospitals to ensure an effective healthcare workforce and strengthen healthcare systems in Kenya.",0,"An Investigation of Healthcare Professionals’ Motivation in Public and Mission Hospitals in Meru County, Kenya Strengthening health systems in developing countries such as Kenya is required to achieve the third United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of health for all, at all ages.

Global mapping of randomised trials related articles published in high-impact-factor medical journals: a cross-sectional analysis,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the most reliable information to inform clinical practice and patient care. We aimed to map global clinical research publication activity through RCT-related articles in high-impact-factor medical journals over the past five decades. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of articles published in the highest ranked medical journals with an impact factor > 10 (according to Journal Citation Reports published in 2017). We searched PubMed/MEDLINE (from inception to December 31, 2017) for all RCT-related articles (e.g. primary RCTs, secondary analyses and methodology papers) published in high-impact-factor medical journals. For each included article, raw metadata were abstracted from the Web of Science. A process of standardization was conducted to unify the different terms and grammatical variants and to remove typographical, transcription and/or indexing errors. Descriptive analyses were conducted (including the number of articles, citations, most prolific authors, countries, journals, funding sources and keywords). Network analyses of collaborations between countries and co-words are presented. RESULTS: We included 39,305 articles (for the period 1965–2017) published in forty journals. The Lancet (n = 3593; 9.1%), the Journal of Clinical Oncology (n = 3343; 8.5%) and The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 3275 articles; 8.3%) published the largest number of RCTs. A total of 154 countries were involved in the production of articles. The global productivity ranking was led by the United States (n = 18,393 articles), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 8028 articles), Canada (n = 4548 articles) and Germany (n = 4415 articles). Seventeen authors who had published 100 or more articles were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Duke University (United States), Harvard University (United States) and McMaster University (Canada). The main funding institutions were the National Institutes of Health (United States), Hoffmann-La Roche (Switzerland), Pfizer (United States), Merck Sharp & Dohme (United States) and Novartis (Switzerland). The 100 most cited RCTs were published in nine journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 78 articles), The Lancet (n = 9 articles) and JAMA (n = 7 articles). These landmark contributions focused on novel methodological approaches (e.g. the “Bland-Altman method”) and trials on the management of chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes control, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, multiple therapies for diverse cancers, cardiovascular therapies such as lipid-lowering statins, antihypertensive medications, and antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis identified authors, countries, funding institutions, landmark contributions and high-impact-factor medical journals publishing RCTs.

Online adaptive radiotherapy compared to plan selection for rectal cancer: quantifying the benefit,"BACKGROUND: To compare online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy (PS) with respect to dose to the organs at risk (OAR) for rectal cancer. METHODS: The first 20 patients treated with PS between May–September 2016 were included. This resulted in 10 short (SCRT) and 10 long (LCRT) course radiotherapy treatment schedules with a total of 300 Conebeam CT scans (CBCT). New dual arc VMAT plans were generated using auto-planning for both the online ART and PS strategy. For each fraction bowel bag, bladder and mesorectum were delineated on daily Conebeam CTs. The dose distribution planned was used to calculate daily DVHs. Coverage of the CTV was calculated, as defined by the dose received by 99% of the CTV volume (D99%). The volume of normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed fraction dose was calculated by calculating the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed fraction or more dose minus the volume of the CTV. For each fraction the difference between the plan selection and online adaptive strategy of each DVH parameter was calculated, as well as the average difference per patient. RESULTS: Target coverage remained the same for online ART. The median volume of the normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed dose dropped from 642 cm3 (PS) to 237 cm3 (online-ART)(p < 0.001). Online ART reduced dose to the OARs for all tested dose levels for SCRT and LCRT (p < 0.001). For V15Gy of the bowel bag the median difference over all fractions of all patients was − 126 cm(3) in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 206 cm(3) to − 40 cm(3). For SCRT the median difference was − 62 cm(3), while the range of the average difference per patient was − 105 cm3 to − 51 cm(3). For V15Gy of the bladder the median difference over all fractions of all patients was 26% in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 34 to 12%. For SCRT the median difference of V95% was − 8%, while the range of the average difference per patient was − 29 to 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Online ART for rectal cancer reduces dose the OARs significantly compared to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy, without compromising target coverage.

Increased RNA virus population diversity improves adaptability,"The replication machinery of most RNA viruses lacks proofreading mechanisms. As a result, RNA virus populations harbor a large amount of genetic diversity that confers them the ability to rapidly adapt to changes in their environment. In this work, we investigate whether further increasing the initial population diversity of a model RNA virus can improve adaptation to a single selection pressure, thermal inactivation. For this, we experimentally increased the diversity of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) populations across the capsid region. We then compared the ability of these high diversity CVB3 populations to achieve resistance to thermal inactivation relative to standard CVB3 populations in an experimental evolution setting. We find that viral populations with high diversity are better able to achieve resistance to thermal inactivation at both the temperature employed during experimental evolution as well as at a more extreme temperature. Moreover, we identify mutations in the CVB3 capsid that confer resistance to thermal inactivation, finding significant mutational epistasis. Our results indicate that even naturally diverse RNA virus populations can benefit from experimental augmentation of population diversity for optimal adaptation and support the use of such viral populations in directed evolution efforts that aim to select viruses with desired characteristics.",0,"Increased RNA virus population diversity improves adaptability The replication machinery of most RNA viruses lacks proofreading mechanisms.

Islands of linkage in an ocean of pervasive recombination reveals two-speed evolution of human cytomegalovirus genomes,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects most of the population worldwide, persisting throughout the host's life in a latent state with periodic episodes of reactivation. While typically asymptomatic, HCMV can cause fatal disease among congenitally infected infants and immunocompromised patients. These clinical issues are compounded by the emergence of antiviral resistance and the absence of an effective vaccine, the development of which is likely complicated by the numerous immune evasins encoded by HCMV to counter the host's adaptive immune responses, a feature that facilitates frequent super-infections. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HCMV is essential for the development of effective new drugs and vaccines. By comparing viral genomes from uncultivated or low-passaged clinical samples of diverse origins, we observe evidence of frequent homologous recombination events, both recent and ancient, and no structure of HCMV genetic diversity at the whole-genome scale. Analysis of individual gene-scale loci reveals a striking dichotomy: while most of the genome is highly conserved, recombines essentially freely and has evolved under purifying selection, 21 genes display extreme diversity, structured into distinct genotypes that do not recombine with each other. Most of these hyper-variable genes encode glycoproteins involved in cell entry or escape of host immunity. Evidence that half of them have diverged through episodes of intense positive selection suggests that rapid evolution of hyper-variable loci is likely driven by interactions with host immunity. It appears that this process is enabled by recombination unlinking hyper-variable loci from strongly constrained neighboring sites. It is conceivable that viral mechanisms facilitating super-infection have evolved to promote recombination between diverged genotypes, allowing the virus to continuously diversify at key loci to escape immune detection, while maintaining a genome optimally adapted to its asymptomatic infectious lifecycle.",0,"Islands of linkage in an ocean of pervasive recombination reveals two-speed evolution of human cytomegalovirus genomes Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects most of the population worldwide, persisting throughout the host's life in a latent state with periodic episodes of reactivation.

Spatial expansions and travelling waves of rabies in vampire bats,"A major obstacle to anticipating the cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases and developing novel strategies for their control is the scarcity of data informing how these pathogens circulate within natural reservoir populations. Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs.",0,"Spatial expansions and travelling waves of rabies in vampire bats A major obstacle to anticipating the cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases and developing novel strategies for their control is the scarcity of data informing how these pathogens circulate within natural reservoir populations.

Accounting for behavioral responses during a flu epidemic using home television viewing,"BACKGROUND: Theory suggests that individual behavioral responses impact the spread of flu-like illnesses, but this has been difficult to empirically characterize. Social distancing is an important component of behavioral response, though analyses have been limited by a lack of behavioral data. Our objective is to use media data to characterize social distancing behavior in order to empirically inform explanatory and predictive epidemiological models. METHODS: We use data on variation in home television viewing as a proxy for variation in time spent in the home and, by extension, contact. This behavioral proxy is imperfect but appealing since information on a rich and representative sample is collected using consistent techniques across time and most major cities. We study the April-May 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 in Central Mexico and examine the dynamic behavioral response in aggregate and contrast the observed patterns of various demographic subgroups. We develop and calibrate a dynamic behavioral model of disease transmission informed by the proxy data on daily variation in contact rates and compare it to a standard (non-adaptive) model and a fixed effects model that crudely captures behavior. RESULTS: We find that after a demonstrable initial behavioral response (consistent with social distancing) at the onset of the outbreak, there was attenuation in the response before the conclusion of the public health intervention. We find substantial differences in the behavioral response across age subgroups and socioeconomic levels. We also find that the dynamic behavioral and fixed effects transmission models better account for variation in new confirmed cases, generate more stable estimates of the baseline rate of transmission over time and predict the number of new cases over a short horizon with substantially less error. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that A/H1N1 had an innate transmission potential greater than previously thought but this was masked by behavioral responses. Observed differences in behavioral response across demographic groups indicate a potential benefit from targeting social distancing outreach efforts.",0,"Accounting for behavioral responses during a flu epidemic using home television viewing BACKGROUND: Theory suggests that individual behavioral responses impact the spread of flu-like illnesses, but this has been difficult to empirically characterize.

Digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics,"When confronted with a globally spreading epidemic, we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination, creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale. Propagating along similar networks, e.g., air-transportation, the spreading dynamics of the supply vs. the demand are, however, fundamentally different, with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics, and the drugs by commodity flow. We show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns: while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations, creating a concurrent global demand, commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread, in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied, while the majority remains deprived. Consequently, even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities, due to the inherent heterogeneity of network-based commodity flow, efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable, as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply. Therefore, we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy, based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics, that, in effect, bypasses the existing distribution networks. Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.",0,"Digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics When confronted with a globally spreading epidemic, we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination, creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale.

Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.",digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics when confronted with a globally spreading epidemic we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale propagating along similar networks eg airtransportation the spreading dynamics of the supply vs the demand are however fundamentally different with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics and the drugs by commodity flow we show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations creating a concurrent global demand commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied while the majority remains deprived consequently even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities due to the inherent heterogeneity of networkbased commodity flow efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply therefore we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics that in effect bypasses the existing distribution networks such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics based on eg short dna sequences or printable chemical compounds that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via dna3d printing technology we test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative saving many more lives with significantly less resources,1
How to use the MEROPS database and website to help understand peptidase specificity,"The MEROPS website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops) and database was established in 1996 to present the classification and nomenclature of proteolytic enzymes. This was expanded to include a classification of protein inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes in 2004. Each peptidase or inhibitor is assigned to a distinct identifier, based on its biochemical and biological properties, and homologous sequences are assembled into a family. Families in which the proteins share similar tertiary structures are assembled into a clan. The MEROPS classification is thus a hierarchy with at least three levels (protein‐species, family, and clan) showing the evolutionary relationship. Several other data collections have been assembled, which are accessed from all levels in the hierarchy. These include, sequence homologs, selective bibliographies, substrate cleavage sites, peptidase–inhibitor interactions, alignments, and phylogenetic trees. The substrate cleavage collection has been assembled from the literature and includes physiological, pathological, and nonphysiological cleavages in proteins, peptides, and synthetic substrates. In this article, we make recommendations about how best to analyze these data and show analyses to indicate peptidase binding site preferences and exclusions. We also identify peptidases where co‐operative binding occurs between adjacent binding sites.",0,"How to use the MEROPS database and website to help understand peptidase specificity The MEROPS website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops) and database was established in 1996 to present the classification and nomenclature of proteolytic enzymes.

Optimization of Machine Learning in Various Situations Using ICT-Based TVOC Sensors,"A computational framework using artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested in numerous fields, such as medicine, robotics, meteorology, and chemistry. The specificity of each AI model and the relationship between data characteristics and ground truth, allowing their guidance according to each situation, has not been given. Since TVOCs (total volatile organic compounds) cause serious harm to human health and plants, the prevention of such damages with a reduction in their occurrence frequency becomes not an optional process but an essential one in manufacturing, as well as for chemical industries and laboratories. In this study, with consideration of the characteristics of the machine learning technique and ICT (information and communications technology), TVOC sensors are explored as a function of grounded data analysis and the selection of machine learning models, determining their performance in real situations. For representative scenarios, considering features from an ICT semiconductor sensor and one targeting TVOC gas, we investigated suitable analysis methods and machine learning models such as LSTM (long short-term memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit), and RNN (recurrent neural network). Detailed factors for these machine learning models with respect to the concentration of TVOC gas in the atmosphere are compared with original sensory data to obtain their accuracy. From this work, we expect to significantly minimize risk in empirical applications, i.e., maintaining homeostasis or predicting abnormal situations to construct an opportune response.",0,"Optimization of Machine Learning in Various Situations Using ICT-Based TVOC Sensors A computational framework using artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested in numerous fields, such as medicine, robotics, meteorology, and chemistry.

Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins through Dynamic Interactions,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are over-represented in major disease pathways and have attracted significant interest in understanding if and how they may be targeted using small molecules for therapeutic purposes. While most existing studies have focused on extending the traditional structure-centric drug design strategies and emphasized exploring pre-existing structure features of IDPs for specific binding, several examples have also emerged to suggest that small molecules could achieve specificity in binding IDPs and affect their function through dynamic and transient interactions. These dynamic interactions can modulate the disordered conformational ensemble and often lead to modest compaction to shield functionally important interaction sites. Much work remains to be done on further elucidation of the molecular basis of the dynamic small molecule–IDP interaction and determining how it can be exploited for targeting IDPs in practice. These efforts will rely critically on an integrated experimental and computational framework for disordered protein ensemble characterization. In particular, exciting advances have been made in recent years in enhanced sampling techniques, Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-computing, and protein force field optimization, which have now allowed rigorous physics-based atomistic simulations to generate reliable structure ensembles for nontrivial IDPs of modest sizes. Such de novo atomistic simulations will play crucial roles in exploring the exciting opportunity of targeting IDPs through dynamic interactions.",0,"Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins through Dynamic Interactions Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are over-represented in major disease pathways and have attracted significant interest in understanding if and how they may be targeted using small molecules for therapeutic purposes.
