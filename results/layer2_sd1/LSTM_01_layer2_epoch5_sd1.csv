"Phylogenetic Exploration of Nosocomial Transmission Chains of 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 among Children Admitted at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa in 2011","Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation. Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission, which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.",0,"Phylogenetic Exploration of Nosocomial Transmission Chains of 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 among Children Admitted at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa in 2011 Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation.

Targeted inhibition of immunodeficiency virus replication in lymphocytes through retroviral mediated gene transfer,"To test the feasibility of gene therapy for AIDS patients, an animal model is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach. Antiviral genes (encoding antisense RNA or viral protein) derived from Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were efficiently targeted into CD4+ lymphocytes through retroviral-mediated gene transfer. After challenging with infectious viruses, the transduced lymphocytes that received antiviral genes were not only protected from SIV infection, but also from infection with HIV, for at least 25 days. Furthermore, little or no cytolytic effect (syncytium formation) was observed in the protected cells. These data demonstrated that SIV or HIV replication could be effectively blocked by antisense sequence(s) or negative dominant factors which were introduced into targeted cells through retroviral-mediated gene transfer.",0,"Targeted inhibition of immunodeficiency virus replication in lymphocytes through retroviral mediated gene transfer To test the feasibility of gene therapy for AIDS patients, an animal model is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach.

"Pathogen surveillance in the informal settlement, Kibera, Kenya, using a metagenomics approach","BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is increasing, highlighting the importance of global disease pathogen surveillance. Traditional population-based methods may fail to capture important events, particularly in settings with limited access to health care, such as urban informal settlements. In such environments, a mixture of surface water runoff and human feces containing pathogenic microorganisms could be used as a surveillance surrogate. METHOD: We conducted a temporal metagenomic analysis of urban sewage from Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, to detect and quantify bacterial and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, viral and parasitic pathogens. Data were examined in conjunction with data from ongoing clinical infectious disease surveillance. RESULTS: A large variation of read abundances related to bacteria, viruses, and parasites of medical importance, as well as bacterial associated antimicrobial resistance genes over time were detected. Significant increased abundances were observed for a number of bacterial pathogens coinciding with higher abundances of AMR genes. Vibrio cholerae as well as rotavirus A, among other virus peaked in several weeks during the study period whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, varied more over time. CONCLUSION: The metagenomic surveillance approach for monitoring circulating pathogens in sewage was able to detect putative pathogen and resistance loads in an urban informal settlement. Thus, valuable if generated in real time to serve as a comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system with the potential to guide disease prevention and treatment. The approach may lead to a paradigm shift in conducting real-time global genomics-based surveillance in settings with limited access to health care.",0,"Pathogen surveillance in the informal settlement, Kibera, Kenya, using a metagenomics approach BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is increasing, highlighting the importance of global disease pathogen surveillance.

Call on me! Undergraduates’ perceptions of voluntarily asking and answering questions in front of large-enrollment science classes,"Allowing students to voluntarily ask and answer questions in front of the whole class are common teaching practices used in college science courses. However, few studies have examined college science students’ perceptions of these practices, the extent to which students choose to engage in these practices, and what discourages students from participating. In this study, we surveyed 417 undergraduates at a research-intensive institution about their experiences asking and answering questions in large-enrollment college science courses. Specifically, students answered questions about to what extent they perceive voluntarily asking and answering questions in large-enrollment science courses is helpful to them and why. They also answered questions about to what extent they engage in asking and answering questions in large-enrollment college science courses and what factors could discourage them from participating. Using binary logistic regression, we examined whether there were differences among students of different demographic groups regarding their opinions about asking and answering questions. We found that overwhelmingly students reported that other students voluntarily asking and answering instructor questions is helpful to them. Notably, compared to continuing generation students, first-generation students were more likely to perceive other students asking questions to be helpful. Despite perceiving asking and answering questions to be helpful, over half of students reported that they never ask or answer questions in large-enrollment college science courses during a semester, and women were more likely than men to report never asking questions. We identified fear of negative evaluation, or students’ sense of dread associated with being unfavorably evaluated, as a primary factor influencing their decision to answer instructor questions. This work adds to a growing body of literature on student participation in large-enrollment college science courses and begins to uncover underlying factors influencing student participation.",0,"Call on me!

Exposing distinct subcortical components of the auditory brainstem response evoked by continuous naturalistic speech,"Speech processing is built upon encoding by the auditory nerve and brainstem, yet we know very little about how these processes unfold in specific subcortical structures. These structures are deep and respond quickly, making them difficult to study during ongoing speech. Recent techniques have begun to address this problem, but yield temporally broad responses with consequently ambiguous neural origins. Here, we describe a method that pairs re-synthesized ‘peaky’ speech with deconvolution analysis of electroencephalography recordings. We show that in adults with normal hearing the method quickly yields robust responses whose component waves reflect activity from distinct subcortical structures spanning auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands and discuss the important practical considerations such as talker choice. The peaky speech method holds promise as a tool for investigating speech encoding and processing, and for clinical applications.",0,"Exposing distinct subcortical components of the auditory brainstem response evoked by continuous naturalistic speech Speech processing is built upon encoding by the auditory nerve and brainstem, yet we know very little about how these processes unfold in specific subcortical structures.

One Health Approach in the South East Asia Region: Opportunities and Challenges,"The outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza, and Nipah virus in Asian countries clearly demonstrated that new highly infectious agents periodically emerge at the human–animal interface. The experiences of regional countries with prevention and control of avian influenza, SARS have reinforced the need for sustained, well-coordinated, multi-sector, multi-disciplinary, community-based actions to address emerging disease threats. ‘One Health’ is a cost-effective, sustainable, and practical approach to find solutions for problems which need holistic, multidisciplinary approaches, particularly in resource-constrained countries. While there is a growing recognition of One Health, it has to be translated from concept into actions through country level activities that are relevant for specific situations.",0,"One Health Approach in the South East Asia Region: Opportunities and Challenges The outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza, and Nipah virus in Asian countries clearly demonstrated that new highly infectious agents periodically emerge at the human–animal interface.

Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: Viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein,"Structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response. Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class 11 binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class 11 binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",0,"Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: Viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein Structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response.

Progress and challenges of disaster health management in China: a scoping review,"BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of an effective health system response to various disasters, relevant research is still in its infancy, especially in middle- and low-income countries. OBJECTIVE: This paper provides an overview of the status of disaster health management in China, with its aim to promote the effectiveness of the health response for reducing disaster-related mortality and morbidity. DESIGN: A scoping review method was used to address the recent progress of and challenges to disaster health management in China. Major health electronic databases were searched to identify English and Chinese literature that were relevant to the research aims. RESULTS: The review found that since 2003 considerable progress has been achieved in the health disaster response system in China. However, there remain challenges that hinder effective health disaster responses, including low standards of disaster-resistant infrastructure safety, the lack of specific disaster plans, poor emergency coordination between hospitals, lack of portable diagnostic equipment and underdeveloped triage skills, surge capacity, and psychological interventions. Additional challenges include the fragmentation of the emergency health service system, a lack of specific legislation for emergencies, disparities in the distribution of funding, and inadequate cost-effective considerations for disaster rescue. CONCLUSIONS: One solution identified to address these challenges appears to be through corresponding policy strategies at multiple levels (e.g. community, hospital, and healthcare system level).",0,"Progress and challenges of disaster health management in China: a scoping review BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of an effective health system response to various disasters, relevant research is still in its infancy, especially in middle- and low-income countries.

Suitability of Text-Based Communications for the Delivery of Psychological Therapeutic Services to Rural and Remote Communities: Scoping Review,"BACKGROUND: People living in rural and remote areas have poorer access to mental health services than those living in cities. They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020. RESULTS: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment.

What’s new in surfactant?: A clinical view on recent developments in neonatology and paediatrics,"Surfactant therapy has significantly changed clinical practice in neonatology over the last 25 years. Recent trials in infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) have not shown superiority of any natural surfactant over another. Advancements in the development of synthetic surfactants are promising, yet to date none has been shown to be superior to natural preparations. Ideally, surfactant would be administered without requiring mechanical ventilation. An increasing number of studies investigate the roles of alternative modes of administration and the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure to minimise the need for mechanical ventilation. Whether children with other lung diseases benefit from surfactant therapy is less clear. Evidence suggests that infants with meconium aspiration syndrome and children with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome may benefit, while no positive effect of surfactant is seen in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. However, more research is needed to establish potential beneficial effects of surfactant administration in children with lung diseases other than RDS. Furthermore, genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism have recently been linked to respiratory diseases of formerly unknown origin. It is important to consider these disorders in the differential diagnosis of unexplained respiratory distress although no established treatment is yet available besides lung transplantation for the most severe cases. Conclusion: Research around surfactant is evolving and recent developments include further evolution of synthetic surfactants, evaluation of surfactant as a therapeutic option in lung diseases other than RDS and the discovery of genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism. Ongoing research is essential to continue to improve therapeutic prospects for children with serious respiratory disease involving disturbances in surfactant.",0,"What’s new in surfactant?: A clinical view on recent developments in neonatology and paediatrics Surfactant therapy has significantly changed clinical practice in neonatology over the last 25 years.

Acute Flaccid Myelitis: Something Old and Something New,"Since 2014, acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a long-recognized condition associated with polioviruses, nonpolio enteroviruses, and various other viral and nonviral causes, has been reemerging globally in epidemic form. This unanticipated reemergence is ironic, given that polioviruses, once the major causes of AFM, are now at the very threshold of global eradication and cannot therefore explain any aspect of AFM reemergence. Instead, the new AFM epidemic has been temporally associated with reemergences of nonpolio enteroviruses such as EV-D68, until recently thought to be an obscure virus of extremely low endemicity. This perspective reviews the enigmatic epidemiologic, virologic, and diagnostic aspects of epidemic AFM reemergence; examines current options for clinical management; discusses future research needs; and suggests that the AFM epidemic offers important clues to mechanisms of viral disease emergence.",0,"Acute Flaccid Myelitis: Something Old and Something New Since 2014, acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a long-recognized condition associated with polioviruses, nonpolio enteroviruses, and various other viral and nonviral causes, has been reemerging globally in epidemic form.

Effect of thermal control of dry fomites on regulating the survival of human pathogenic bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections,"We monitored the survival of human pathogenic bacteria [Escherichia coli (ATCC), extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli (Clinical isolate), New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing E. coli (clinical isolate), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC)] on dry materials (vinyl chloride, aluminum, plastic, stainless steel) at distinct temperatures (room temperature or 15°C–37°C). These bacteria favored a lower temperature for their prolonged survival on the dry fomites, regardless of the material type. Interestingly, when mixed with S. aureus, E. coli survived for a longer time at a lower temperature. Cardiolipin, which can promote the survival of S. aureus in harsh environments, had no effect on maintaining the survival of E. coli. Although the trends remained unchanged, adjusting the humidity from 40% to 60% affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed no morphological differences in these bacteria immediately before or after one day of dry conditions. In addition, ATP assessment, a method used to visualize high-touch surfaces in hospitals, was not effective at monitoring bacterial dynamics. A specialized handrail device fitted with a heater, which was maintained at normal human body core temperature, successfully prohibited the prolonged survival of bacteria [Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC), E. coli (ATCC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC), S. aureus (ATCC), Acinetobacter baumannii (clinical isolate), and Serratia marcescens (clinical isolate)], with the exception of spore-forming Bacillus subtilis (from our laboratory collection) and the yeast-like fungus Candida albicans (from our laboratory collection)] on dry surfaces. Taken together, we concluded that the tested bacteria favor lower temperatures for their survival in dry environments.

"Human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural coastal Kenya, 2015-2016, observed through outpatient surveillance","Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the predominant cause of upper respiratory tract infections, resulting in a significant public health burden. The virus circulates as many different types (168), each generating strong homologous, but weak heterotypic, immunity. The influence of these features on transmission patterns of HRV in the community is understudied. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at nine out-patient facilities across a Health and Demographic Surveillance System between December 2015 and November 2016. HRV was diagnosed by real-time RT-PCR, and the VP4/VP2 genomic region of the positive samples sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the HRV types. Classification models and G-test statistic were used to investigate HRV type spatial distribution. Demographic characteristics and clinical features of ARI were also compared. Results: Of 5,744 NPS samples collected, HRV was detected in 1057 (18.4%), of which 817 (77.3%) were successfully sequenced. HRV species A, B and C were identified in 360 (44.1%), 67 (8.2%) and 390 (47.7%) samples, respectively. In total, 87 types were determined: 39, 10 and 38 occurred within species A, B and C, respectively. HRV types presented heterogeneous temporal patterns of persistence. Spatially, identical types occurred over a wide distance at similar times, but there was statistically significant evidence for clustering of types between health facilities in close proximity or linked by major road networks. Conclusion: This study records a high prevalence of HRV in out-patient presentations exhibiting high type diversity. Patterns of occurrence suggest frequent and independent community invasion of different types. Temporal differences of persistence between types may reflect variation in type-specific population immunity. Spatial patterns suggest either rapid spread or multiple invasions of the same type, but evidence of similar types amongst close health facilities, or along road systems, indicate type partitioning structured by local spread.",0,"Human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural coastal Kenya, 2015-2016, observed through outpatient surveillance Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the predominant cause of upper respiratory tract infections, resulting in a significant public health burden.

Oligonucleotide Functionalised Microbeads: Indispensable Tools for High-Throughput Aptamer Selection,"The functionalisation of microbeads with oligonucleotides has become an indispensable technique for high-throughput aptamer selection in SELEX protocols. In addition to simplifying the separation of binding and non-binding aptamer candidates, microbeads have facilitated the integration of other technologies such as emulsion PCR (ePCR) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to high-throughput selection techniques. Within these systems, monoclonal aptamer microbeads can be individually generated and assayed to assess aptamer candidate fitness thereby helping eliminate stochastic effects which are common to classical SELEX techniques. Such techniques have given rise to aptamers with 1000 times greater binding affinities when compared to traditional SELEX. Another emerging technique is Fluorescence Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) whereby selection does not rely on binding capture allowing evolution of a greater diversity of aptamer properties such as fluorescence or enzymatic activity. Within this review we explore examples and applications of oligonucleotide functionalised microbeads in aptamer selection and reflect upon new opportunities arising for aptamer science.",0,"Oligonucleotide Functionalised Microbeads: Indispensable Tools for High-Throughput Aptamer Selection The functionalisation of microbeads with oligonucleotides has become an indispensable technique for high-throughput aptamer selection in SELEX protocols.

Food Innovation Adoption and Organic Food Consumerism—A Cross National Study between Malaysia and Hungary,"In order to meet the rising global demand for food and to ensure food security in line with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 2, technological advances have been introduced in the food production industry. The organic food industry has benefitted from advances in food technology and innovation. However, there remains skepticism regarding organic foods on the part of consumers, specifically on consumers’ acceptance of food innovation technologies used in the production of organic foods. This study measured factors that influence consumers’ food innovation adoption and subsequently their intention to purchase organic foods. We compared the organic foods purchase behavior of Malaysian and Hungarian consumers to examine differences between Asian and European consumers. The findings show food innovation adoption as the most crucial predictor for the intention to purchase organic foods in Hungary, while social lifestyle factor was the most influential in Malaysia. Other factors such as environmental concerns and health consciousness were also examined in relation to food innovation adoption and organic food consumerism.

Age-specific risk factors of severe pneumonia among pediatric patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Risk factors that predispose the development of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among pediatric CAP patients of different age ranges are yet to be identified. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pediatric in-patients (< 6 years old) diagnosed with CAP in our hospital. We subdivided patients into four age groups (< 6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1–2 years, and 2–6 years). Their medical records, including demographic information, clinical features, laboratory findings, and chest radiographic reports, were reviewed and collected for further analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis and stepwise regression analysis were applied to identify risk factors associated with severe CAP and ICU admission for overall patients and age-stratified subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 20,174 cases were initially included. Among them, 3309 (16.40%) cases were identified as severe CAP, and 2824 (14.00%) cases required ICU admission. Potential risk factors for severe CAP and ICU admission identified by univariate analysis included younger age, rural residency, premature birth, low birth weight (LBW), formula feeding, congenital heart disease (CHD), history of pneumonia or neonatal jaundice, patients with other health issues, certain symptoms (manifesting wheezing, dyspnea, cyanosis, but have no cough or fever), abnormal laboratory findings (abnormal levels of white blood cells, albumin, and C-reactive protein and RSV infection), and chest X-ray (odds ratio [OR] > 1 for all). CHD, low albumin, proteinuria, abnormal chest x-ray were independent risks factors across different age groups, whereas birth or feeding history, history of pneumonia, cyanosis or dyspnea on admission, and RSV infection were independent risk factors for only younger kids (< 1 year), and wheezing was an independent risk factor only for older children (2–5 years old). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors predicting disease severity among children hospitalized with CAP vary with age. Risk factor stratification of pediatric CAP based on age-specific risk factors can better guide clinical practice.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pediatric in-patients (< 6 years old) diagnosed with CAP in our hospital. We subdivided patients into four age groups (< 6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1–2 years, and 2–6 years). Their medical records, including demographic information, clinical features, laboratory findings, and chest radiographic reports, were reviewed and collected for further analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis and stepwise regression analysis were applied to identify risk factors associated with severe CAP and ICU admission for overall patients and age-stratified subgroups.

Generation of protective pneumococcal-specific nasal resident memory CD4(+) T cells via parenteral immunization,"The generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM)) is an essential aspect of immunity at mucosal surfaces, and it has been suggested that preferential generation of T(RM) is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines. We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T(RM) are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4(+) mucosal T(RM). Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17A(+)CD4(+) T(RM) in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T(RM) in prevention of pneumococcal colonization, and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization. Our findings therefore have important implications regarding the generation of immune protection at mucosal surfaces by vaccination.",0,"Generation of protective pneumococcal-specific nasal resident memory CD4(+) T cells via parenteral immunization The generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM)) is an essential aspect of immunity at mucosal surfaces, and it has been suggested that preferential generation of T(RM) is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines.

New Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Therapeutic Strategies Based on the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/Angiotensin-(1–7)/Mas Receptor Axis,"Angiotensin (Ang)-(1–7) is now recognized as a biologically active component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The discovery of the angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue ACE2 revealed important metabolic pathways involved in the Ang-(1–7) synthesis. This enzyme can form Ang-(1–7) from Ang II or less efficiently through hydrolysis of Ang I to Ang-(1–9) with subsequent Ang-(1–7) formation. Additionally, it is well established that the G protein-coupled receptor Mas is a functional ligand site for Ang-(1–7). The axis formed by ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas represents an endogenous counter regulatory pathway within the RAS whose actions are opposite to the vasoconstrictor/proliferative arm of the RAS constituted by ACE/Ang II/AT(1) receptor. In this review we will discuss recent findings concerning the biological role of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas arm in the cardiovascular and pulmonary system.

Overview of Virus Metagenomic Classification Methods and Their Biological Applications,"Metagenomics poses opportunities for clinical and public health virology applications by offering a way to assess complete taxonomic composition of a clinical sample in an unbiased way. However, the techniques required are complicated and analysis standards have yet to develop. This, together with the wealth of different tools and workflows that have been proposed, poses a barrier for new users. We evaluated 49 published computational classification workflows for virus metagenomics in a literature review. To this end, we described the methods of existing workflows by breaking them up into five general steps and assessed their ease-of-use and validation experiments. Performance scores of previous benchmarks were summarized and correlations between methods and performance were investigated. We indicate the potential suitability of the different workflows for (1) time-constrained diagnostics, (2) surveillance and outbreak source tracing, (3) detection of remote homologies (discovery), and (4) biodiversity studies. We provide two decision trees for virologists to help select a workflow for medical or biodiversity studies, as well as directions for future developments in clinical viral metagenomics.",0,"Overview of Virus Metagenomic Classification Methods and Their Biological Applications Metagenomics poses opportunities for clinical and public health virology applications by offering a way to assess complete taxonomic composition of a clinical sample in an unbiased way.

Peptide-Based Vaccines: Current Progress and Future Challenges,"[Image: see text] Vaccines have had a profound impact on the management and prevention of infectious disease. In addition, the development of vaccines against chronic diseases has attracted considerable interest as an approach to prevent, rather than treat, conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and others. Subunit vaccines consist of nongenetic components of the infectious agent or disease-related epitope. In this Review, we discuss peptide-based vaccines and their potential in three therapeutic areas: infectious disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. We discuss factors that contribute to vaccine efficacy and how these parameters may potentially be modulated by design. We examine both clinically tested vaccines as well as nascent approaches and explore current challenges and potential remedies. While peptide vaccines hold substantial promise in the prevention of human disease, many obstacles remain that have hampered their clinical use; thus, continued research efforts to address these challenges are warranted.",0,"Peptide-Based Vaccines: Current Progress and Future Challenges [Image: see text] Vaccines have had a profound impact on the management and prevention of infectious disease.

Core Self-Evaluations Mediate the Associations of Dispositional Optimism and Life Satisfaction,"BACKGROUND: Positive traits, such as life satisfaction, optimism, and core self-evaluation (CSE), have garnered increasing attention from researchers and professionals. However, the trilateral relationship among them remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction and primarily verified the mediator role of CSEs. METHODS: Six hundred thirty college students from two general universities completed a questionnaire packet containing life orientation test–revised (LOT–R), core self-evaluations, and satisfaction with life scale. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the dimension of LOT–R. Bootstrap was used in structural equation modeling to analyze mediation effect. RESULTS: Results revealed that dispositional optimism and core self-evaluations were significantly correlated with life satisfaction. CFA identified the bidimensional structure of dispositional optimism. SEM indicated that core self-evaluations partially mediated the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction. The final model also revealed significant paths from optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction through core-self evaluations. CONCLUSION: The findings extended prior studies and shed light on how dispositional optimism influences life satisfaction. This study provides valuable evidence on how to promote the life satisfaction of human beings in positive psychology. A further study can fully explore the relationship among them in multi-cultural follow-up studies.",0,"Core Self-Evaluations Mediate the Associations of Dispositional Optimism and Life Satisfaction BACKGROUND: Positive traits, such as life satisfaction, optimism, and core self-evaluation (CSE), have garnered increasing attention from researchers and professionals.

Development of Clinical-Stage Human Monoclonal Antibodies That Treat Advanced Ebola Virus Disease in Nonhuman Primates,"BACKGROUND: For most classes of drugs, rapid development of therapeutics to treat emerging infections is challenged by the timelines needed to identify compounds with the desired efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases. METHODS: In this study, we deployed a platform to generate, test, and develop fully human antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus. We obtained specific anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable regions in their humoral responses. RESULTS: Of the antibody clones isolated, 3 were selected as best at neutralizing EBOV and triggering FcγRIIIa. Binding studies and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the 3 selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes, including a potentially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments. When combined, a single dose of a cocktail of the 3 antibodies protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) from EBOV disease even after disease symptoms were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: This antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions, incorporates novel specificities, and demonstrates high-level postexposure protection from lethal EBOV disease in NHPs. It is now undergoing testing in normal healthy volunteers in preparation for potential use in future Ebola epidemics.",0,"Development of Clinical-Stage Human Monoclonal Antibodies That Treat Advanced Ebola Virus Disease in Nonhuman Primates BACKGROUND: For most classes of drugs, rapid development of therapeutics to treat emerging infections is challenged by the timelines needed to identify compounds with the desired efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles.

Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila,"Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution. As a result, Drosophila can be used to deconstruct many of the key events in host-pathogen interactions by using a wealth of well-developed molecular and genetic tools. In this review, we aim to emphasize the great leverage provided by the suite of genomic and classical genetic approaches available in flies for decoding details of host-pathogen interactions; these findings can then be applied to studies in higher organisms. We first briefly summarize the general strategies by which Drosophila resists and responds to pathogens. We then focus on how recently developed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens conducted in cells and flies, combined with classical genetic methods, have provided molecular insight into host-pathogen interactions, covering examples of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Finally, we discuss novel strategies for how flies can be used as a tool to examine how specific isolated virulence factors act on an intact host.",0,"Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution.

Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States: 1999–2018,"Low intakes of fruits and vegetables have resulted in suboptimal intakes of several micronutrients, including vitamin C. This cross-sectional study used data from 84,902 children/adults (≥1 y) who completed a 24-h dietary recall as part of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2018). Mean vitamin C intakes from foods/beverages were calculated as were trends in major food/beverage sources of vitamin C. Percentages below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) were estimated. Overall, mean vitamin C consumption declined by 23% (97–75 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). 100% fruit juice was the leading source of vitamin C (25.6% of total or 21.7mg/d), but this declined by 48% (25–13 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). Whole fruit increased among children/adolescents (+75.8%;10–17 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001), but not adults, while the vegetable contribution was generally unchanged. The proportion of the population below the EAR increased by 23.8% on a relative scale or 9 percentage points on an absolute scale (38.3–47.4%). Declines in vitamin C intake is driven largely by decreases in fruit juice coupled with modest increases in whole fruit.

INAPPARENT INTRAUTERINE HSV INFECTION DETECTED BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,"We have used glucose oxidate-avidin-biotin (GAB) immunohistochemistry to detect herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 & 2 virion antigen in fixed tissue. Cases were selected by placental or cord pathology &/or clinical findings in the fetus/neonate. Virus was detected in placenta, umbilical cord &/or fetal/infant organs from 17 pregnancies (1 set twins; 15 newborns & 3 stillborns). Antigen was found in single mesenchymal & epithelial cells without characteristic viral cytopathology. Viral cultures were positive in one case (skin vesicles). Five mothers had clinical or laboratory evidence of HSV 1/2 infections before or during pregnancy, but none had evidence of active infection at delivery. Thirteen pregnancies ended prematurely & 5 infants/fetuses were small for gestational age. Ten newborns were severely ill. Four infants died before 7-1/2 months of age. Of 11 survivors, 2 have severe CNS abnormalities, 1 persistent pulmonary disease & 2 remain hospitalized. Diagnoses associated with GAB positive herpes virus in specific organs include NEC, hepatitis with cholestatic jaundice, interstitial pneumonitis, aseptic meningitis, progressive cystic brain degeneration, & cardiac arrhythmias.

Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Neutrophil Recruitment in Acute Lung Injury—A Unifying Hypothesis? What We Have Learned from Small Interfering RNAs,"In spite of protective ventilatory strategies, Acute Lung Injury (ALI) remains associated with high morbidity and mortality. One reason for the lack of therapeutic options might be that ALI is a co-morbid event associated with a diverse family of diseases and, thus, may be the result of distinct pathological processes. Among them, activated neutrophil- (PMN-) induced tissue injury and epithelial cell apoptosis mediated lung damage represent two potentially important candidate pathomechanisms that have been put forward. Several approaches have been undertaken to test these hypotheses, with substantial success in the treatment of experimental forms of ALI. With this in mind, we will summarize these two current hypotheses of ALI briefly, emphasizing the role of apoptosis in regulating PMN and/or lung epithelial cell responses. In addition, the contribution that Fas-mediated inflammation may play as a potential biological link between lung cell apoptosis and PMN recruitment will be considered, as well as the in vivo application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) as a novel approach to the inhibition of ALI and its therapeutic implications.",0,"Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Neutrophil Recruitment in Acute Lung Injury—A Unifying Hypothesis?

Investigating the effect of authentic leadership and employees' psychological capital on work engagement: evidence from Indonesia,"This study aims at investigating the positive effect of Authentic Leadership on Work Engagement and the mediating role of Psychological Capital (PsyCap). This study employed the Jobs Demands Resource (JD-R) model theory to explain the contribution of Authentic Leadership and PsyCap on Work Engagement. Also, the direct effect of Authentic Leadership on employees' PsyCap was examined. This study randomly selected participants from 1,120 employees in one of the largest public service offices in Indonesia. 192 employees (male = 120 or 62.5%) fully participated in a three-wave data collection. By using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique, this study confirmed that the proposed theoretical model (χ(2)/df = 2, p < .05, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .07, CFI = .95) showed a better fit than the alternative model (χ(2)/df = 3, p < .05, RMSEA = .09, SRMR = .09, CFI = .85). The results also confirmed that Authentic Leadership and PsyCap directly predicted Work Engagement. Furthermore, the indirect effect of Authentic Leadership on Work Engagement was positively mediated by employees' PsyCap. Authentic Leadership in Indonesian public organizations may provide a tremendous impact on employees' PsyCap and Work Engagement.

Epigenetics in modulating immune functions of stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,"Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in cancer cells has been extensively studied in recent decades, resulting in the FDA approval of multiple epigenetic agents for treating different cancer types. Recent studies have revealed novel roles of epigenetic dysregulation in altering the phenotypes of immune cells and tumor-associated stromal cells, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells. As a result, epigenetic dysregulation of these cells reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME), changing it from an antitumor environment to an immunosuppressive environment. Here, we review recent studies demonstrating how specific epigenetic mechanisms drive aspects of stromal and immune cell differentiation with implications for the development of solid tumor therapeutics, focusing on the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) TME as a representative of solid tumors. Due to their unique ability to reprogram the TME into a more immunopermissive environment, epigenetic agents have great potential for sensitizing cancer immunotherapy to augment the antitumor response, as an immunopermissive TME is a prerequisite for the success of cancer immunotherapy but is often not developed with solid tumors. The idea of combining epigenetic agents with cancer immunotherapy has been tested both in preclinical settings and in multiple clinical trials. In this review, we highlight the basic biological mechanisms underlying the synergy between epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy and discuss current efforts to translate this knowledge into clinical benefits for patients.",0,"Epigenetics in modulating immune functions of stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in cancer cells has been extensively studied in recent decades, resulting in the FDA approval of multiple epigenetic agents for treating different cancer types.

With this data, we describe the personal experience of at-home internet inaccessibility. We then focus on how limited, or a lack of access shapes the perceptions of community connectedness and disadvantage among those affected by the divide. Our findings demonstrate the internet’s function as social infrastructure; differences in access are then conceptualized as a form of socioeconomic inequality.",0,"Offline World: the Internet as Social Infrastructure among the Unconnected in Quasi-Rural Illinois The United States continues to experience a persistent rural-urban digital divide.

Evidence for the Convergence Model: The Emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) in Viet Nam,"Building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases (EID), the ‘convergence model’ was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence. The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model’s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.",0,"Evidence for the Convergence Model: The Emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) in Viet Nam Building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases (EID), the ‘convergence model’ was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Other Culture Negative Sepsis-Like Syndromes in the ICU,"There are many sepsis-like inflammatory syndromes that may be encountered by critical care practitioners. Clinically, these syndromes may imitate sepsis and are often identified after an extensive, but unrevealing evaluation for infection. In some instances, these syndromes are anticipated complications of advanced therapies for malignancy. It is vitally important to identify these disorders and treat them with specific chemotherapeutic or immunomodulating therapies. This chapter will focus on hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis (HLH), a rare disorder of pathologic immune system activation that presents as a sepsis-like illness in the critically ill. While treatment of HLH with chemotherapy and immunosuppression should be guided by an expert hematologist, the diagnosis is often made by the critical care medicine practitioner. We present a case illustrating the challenges of defining this syndrome in a patient with recurrent critical illness, and review the evidence underlying diagnostic and prognostic criteria for this protean syndrome. We also review several of the more common sepsis-like inflammatory syndromes that are encountered in the critical care unit along with their specific treatments.",0,"Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Other Culture Negative Sepsis-Like Syndromes in the ICU There are many sepsis-like inflammatory syndromes that may be encountered by critical care practitioners.

A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment,"The use of antiviral drugs has been recognized as the primary public health strategy for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic strain. However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy.",0,"A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment The use of antiviral drugs has been recognized as the primary public health strategy for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic strain.

Development of Saudi e-health literacy scale for chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia: using integrated health literacy dimensions,"OBJECTIVE: Health literacy has become a global issue, and it is important that patients and individuals are able to use information technology to access health information and educational services. The research objective is to develop a Saudi e-health literacy scale (SeHL) for measuring e-health literacy among Saudis suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCD). METHODS: Overall, 14 relevant papers in related interdisciplinary fields were reviewed to select the most useful literacy dimensions. From these articles, we extracted the most common dimensions used to measure e-health literacy across the disciplines. Multiple workshops with multidisciplinary team members reviewed and evaluated items for SeHL. RESULTS: Four key aspects of e-health literacy—use of technology/media, information-seeking, usefulness and confidence—were identified and integrated as e-health literacy dimensions. These will be used to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients with NCDs. A translation from Arabic to English was performed in order to ensure that translation process was accurate. A SeHL scale was developed to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients. By understanding e-health literacy levels, we will be able to create a patient-education system to be used by patients in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSIONS: As information technology is increasingly used by people of all ages all over the world, e-health literacy has been identified as a key factor in determining health outcomes. To date, no comprehensive scale exists to assess e-health literacy levels among speakers of Arabic, particularly among people with NCD such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension.",0,"Development of Saudi e-health literacy scale for chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia: using integrated health literacy dimensions OBJECTIVE: Health literacy has become a global issue, and it is important that patients and individuals are able to use information technology to access health information and educational services.

Younger North Americans are exposed to more radon gas due to occupancy biases within the residential built environment,"Residential buildings can concentrate radioactive radon gas, exposing occupants to particle radiation that increases lung cancer risk. This has worsened over time in North America, with newer residences containing greater radon. Using data from 18,971 Canadian households, we calculated annual particle radiation dose rates due to long term residential radon exposure, and examined this as a function of occupant demographics. The current particle radiation dose rate to lungs from residential radon in Canada is 4.08 mSv/y from 108.2 Bq/m(3), with 23.4% receiving 100–2655 mSv doses that are known to elevate human cancer risk. Notably, residences built in the twenty-first century are occupied by significantly younger people experiencing greater radiation dose rates from radon (mean age of 46 at 5.01 mSv/y), relative to older groups more likely to occupy twentieth century-built properties (mean age of 53 at 3.45–4.22 mSv/y). Newer, higher radon-containing properties are also more likely to have minors, pregnant women and an overall higher number of occupants living there full time. As younger age-of-exposure to radon equates to greater lifetime lung cancer risk, these data reveal a worst case scenario of exposure bias. This is of concern as, if it continues, it forecasts serious future increases in radon-induced lung cancer in younger people.",0,"Younger North Americans are exposed to more radon gas due to occupancy biases within the residential built environment Residential buildings can concentrate radioactive radon gas, exposing occupants to particle radiation that increases lung cancer risk.

Improved Global Capacity for Influenza Surveillance,"During 2004–2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with 39 national governments to strengthen global influenza surveillance. Using World Health Organization data and program evaluation indicators collected by CDC in 2013, we retrospectively evaluated progress made 4–9 years after the start of influenza surveillance capacity strengthening in the countries. Our results showed substantial increases in laboratory and sentinel surveillance capacities, which are essential for knowing which influenza strains circulate globally, detecting emergence of novel influenza, identifying viruses for vaccine selection, and determining the epidemiology of respiratory illness. Twenty-eight of 35 countries responding to a 2013 questionnaire indicated that they have leveraged routine influenza surveillance platforms to detect other pathogens.

Restrictive Measures in an Influenza Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Public Perspectives,"OBJECTIVES: Recent experiences have demonstrated that restrictive measures remain a useful public health tool during infectious disease outbreaks. However, the use of restrictive measures is not without controversy, as there is no agreed-upon threshold for when and how to invoke restrictive measures. The objectives of this study are to solicit perspectives from Canadians on the ethical considerations of using restrictive measures in response to influenza pandemics, and in turn, to use public views to contribute to a better understanding of what is considered to be the justifiable use of restrictive measures. METHODS: A series of town hall focus groups with Canadian residents from June 2008 to May 2009, in three Canadian regions, in order to achieve broad public engagement (n=3 focus groups with a total of 17 participants). RESULTS: Two key themes emerged from all town hall focus groups: 1) create an environment for compliance through communication rather than enforcement, and 2) establish the delineation between individual rights, community values, and the greater good. CONCLUSION: While there is a need for a decision-making authority and even a mechanism for enforcement, our data suggest that a more tractable approach to restrictive measures is one that enables individuals to voluntarily comply by creating an environment to compel compliance based on communication. This approach requires restrictive measures to be a) proportional to the threat, b) implemented along with reciprocal arrangements provided to those affected, and c) accompanied by open and transparent communication throughout all stages so that citizens can both understand and participate in decision-making.",0,"Restrictive Measures in an Influenza Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Public Perspectives OBJECTIVES: Recent experiences have demonstrated that restrictive measures remain a useful public health tool during infectious disease outbreaks.

Preoperative Assessment and Management of Patients with Pain and Anxiety Disorders,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes selected recent evidence on issues important for preoperative pain evaluation. RECENT FINDINGS: Opioids, though a mainstay of postoperative pain management, are associated with both short and increasingly recognized long-term risks, including persistent opioid use. Risk factors for high levels of acute postoperative pain as well as chronic postsurgical pain may overlap, including psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, and catastrophizing. Tools to predict those at risk for poor postoperative pain outcomes are being studied. SUMMARY: Preoperative pain and psychological factors can affect postoperative pain outcomes. More work is needed in the future to develop practical interventions in the preoperative period to address these factors.",0,"Preoperative Assessment and Management of Patients with Pain and Anxiety Disorders PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes selected recent evidence on issues important for preoperative pain evaluation.

Inflammatory Molecules Associated with Ultraviolet Radiation-Mediated Skin Aging,"Skin is the largest and most complex organ in the human body comprised of multiple layers with different types of cells. Different kinds of environmental stressors, for example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), temperature, air pollutants, smoking, and diet, accelerate skin aging by stimulating inflammatory molecules. Skin aging caused by UVR is characterized by loss of elasticity, fine lines, wrinkles, reduced epidermal and dermal components, increased epidermal permeability, delayed wound healing, and approximately 90% of skin aging. These external factors can cause aging through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inflammation, as well as aged skin is a source of circulatory inflammatory molecules which accelerate skin aging and cause aging-related diseases.

Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency,"BACKGROUND: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability. The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health. This was conducted in context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS), the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in Minnesota. Data Quality (DQ) dimensions by Strong et al., was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation. METHODS: The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended format from November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team. RESULTS: All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a combined effort by MEDSS Informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals. CONCLUSION: With increasing electronic reporting to public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future.",0,"Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency BACKGROUND: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability.

Periodontal Disease and Senescent Cells: New Players for an Old Oral Health Problem?,"The recent identification of senescent cells in periodontal tissues has the potential to provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of periodontal disease etiology. DNA damage-driven senescence is perhaps one of the most underappreciated delayed consequences of persistent Gram-negative bacterial infection and inflammation. Although the host immune response rapidly protects against bacterial invasion, oxidative stress generated during inflammation can indirectly deteriorate periodontal tissues through the damage to vital cell macromolecules, including DNA. What happens to those healthy cells that reside in this harmful environment? Emerging evidence indicates that cells that survive irreparable genomic damage undergo cellular senescence, a crucial intermediate mechanism connecting DNA damage and the immune response. In this review, we hypothesize that sustained Gram-negative bacterial challenge, chronic inflammation itself, and the constant renewal of damaged tissues create a permissive environment for the abnormal accumulation of senescent cells. Based on emerging data we propose a model in which the dysfunctional presence of senescent cells may aggravate the initial immune reaction against pathogens. Further understanding of the role of senescent cells in periodontal disease pathogenesis may have clinical implications by providing more sophisticated therapeutic strategies to combat tissue destruction.",0,"Periodontal Disease and Senescent Cells: New Players for an Old Oral Health Problem?

Advance care planning in older hospitalised patients following an emergency admission: A mixed methods study,"INTRODUCTION: Although advance care planning may be beneficial for older adults in the last year of life, its relevance following an emergency hospitalisation requires further investigation. This study quantifies the one-year mortality outcomes of all emergency admissions for patients aged 70+ years and explores patient views on the value of advance care planning following acute hospitalisation. METHOD: This mixed methods study used a two-stage approach: firstly, a quantitative longitudinal cohort study exploring the one-year mortality of patients aged 70+ admitted as an emergency to a large multi-centre hospital cohort; secondly, a qualitative semi-structured interview study gathering information on patient views of advance care planning. RESULTS: There were 14,260 emergency admissions for 70+-year olds over a 12-month period. One-year mortality for admissions across all conditions was 22.6%. The majority of these deaths (59.3%) were within 3 months of admission. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated higher one-year mortality with increasing age and male sex. Interviews with 20 patients resulted in one superordinate theme, “Planning for health and wellbeing in the spectrum of illness”. Sub-themes entitled (1) Advance care planning benefitting healthcare for physical and psycho-social health, (2) Contemplation of physical deterioration death and dying and 3) Collaborating with healthcare professionals to undertake advance care planning, suggest that views of advance care planning are shaped by experiences of acute hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: Since approximately 1 in 5 patients aged 70+ admitted to hospital as an emergency are in the last year of life, acute hospitalisation can act as a trigger for tailored ACP. Older hospitalised patients believe that advance care planning can benefit physical and psychosocial health and that discussions should consider a spectrum of possibilities, from future health to the potential of chronic illness, disability and death. In this context, patients may look for expertise from healthcare professionals for planning their future care.",0,"Advance care planning in older hospitalised patients following an emergency admission: A mixed methods study INTRODUCTION: Although advance care planning may be beneficial for older adults in the last year of life, its relevance following an emergency hospitalisation requires further investigation.

Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of Human Parainfluenza Viruses 1–4 in Children from Viet Nam,"HPIVs are serologically and genetically grouped into four species that account for up to 10% of all hospitalizations due to acute respiratory infection in children under the age of five. Genetic and epidemiological data for the four HPIVs derived from two pediatric cohorts in Viet Nam are presented. Respiratory samples were screened for HPIV1–4 by real-time PCR. Demographic and clinical data of patients infected with different HPIV were compared. We used a hemi-nested PCR approach to generate viral genome sequences from HPIV-positive samples and conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. In total, 170 samples tested positive for HPIV. HPIV3 was most commonly detected in our cohort and 80 co-detections of HPIV with other respiratory viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses suggest local endemic circulation as well as punctuated introductions of new HPIV lineages. Viral gene flow analysis revealed that Viet Nam is a net importer of viral genetic diversity. Epidemiological analyses imply similar disease severity for all HPIV species. HPIV sequences from Viet Nam formed local clusters and were interspersed with sequences from diverse geographic regions. Combined, this new knowledge will help to investigate global HPIV circulation patterns in more detail and ultimately define more suitable vaccine strains.",0,"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of Human Parainfluenza Viruses 1–4 in Children from Viet Nam HPIVs are serologically and genetically grouped into four species that account for up to 10% of all hospitalizations due to acute respiratory infection in children under the age of five.

Taking Bioinformatics to Systems Medicine,"Systems medicine promotes a range of approaches and strategies to study human health and disease at a systems level with the aim of improving the overall well-being of (healthy) individuals, and preventing, diagnosing, or curing disease. In this chapter we discuss how bioinformatics critically contributes to systems medicine. First, we explain the role of bioinformatics in the management and analysis of data. In particular we show the importance of publicly available biological and clinical repositories to support systems medicine studies. Second, we discuss how the integration and analysis of multiple types of omics data through integrative bioinformatics may facilitate the determination of more predictive and robust disease signatures, lead to a better understanding of (patho)physiological molecular mechanisms, and facilitate personalized medicine. Third, we focus on network analysis and discuss how gene networks can be constructed from omics data and how these networks can be decomposed into smaller modules. We discuss how the resulting modules can be used to generate experimentally testable hypotheses, provide insight into disease mechanisms, and lead to predictive models. Throughout, we provide several examples demonstrating how bioinformatics contributes to systems medicine and discuss future challenges in bioinformatics that need to be addressed to enable the advancement of systems medicine.",0,"Taking Bioinformatics to Systems Medicine Systems medicine promotes a range of approaches and strategies to study human health and disease at a systems level with the aim of improving the overall well-being of (healthy) individuals, and preventing, diagnosing, or curing disease.

A Mobile Patient-Facing App for Tracking Patient-Reported Outcomes in Head and Neck Cancer Survivors: Single-Arm Feasibility Study,"BACKGROUND: Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) frequently experience disease-related symptoms and treatment adverse effects that impact their overall quality of life. Cancer-specific mobile health apps for patient-related outcomes allow patients to communicate with their clinicians and proactively track their symptoms, which have been shown to improve clinical management and disease outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of LogPAL, a novel iPhone-based mobile health app designed to help HNC survivors track and manage their posttreatment symptoms. METHODS: Patients who completed curative treatment for HNC in the preceding 24 months were recruited from 2 clinical sites within a single institution. Upon enrollment, participants completed a brief sociodemographic survey, downloaded the app onto their iPhone devices, and were asked to complete a series of biweekly questionnaires (based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) via the app for an 8-week study period. The primary feasibility endpoints included retention (retaining >80% of the enrolled participants for the duration of the study period), adherence (>50% of the participants completing 100% of the questionnaires over the study period), and usability (a mean system usability scale [SUS] score >68). Additional postintervention questions were collected to assess perceived usefulness, acceptance, and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Between January and October 2019, 38 participants were enrolled in the study. Three participants dropped out, and 3 were classified as nonusers. The remaining 32 (87%) were eligible for analysis. Their mean age was 57.8 (SD 12.3) years (range 24-77 years, 81% [26/32] male). Overall, 375 of 512 (73.2%) questionnaires were completed, with 17 (53%) of the 32 participants adherent. Participant-reported usability was acceptable; the mean SUS score was 71.9 (95% CI 64.3-79.5) with high satisfaction of LogPAL usefulness and likelihood to recommend to other cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: This single-arm prospective pilot study showed that LogPAL is a feasible, regularly used, accepted app for HNC survivors, justifying a full-scale pilot. Based on the findings from this study, future iterations will aim to improve usability and test intervention efficacy.",0,"A Mobile Patient-Facing App for Tracking Patient-Reported Outcomes in Head and Neck Cancer Survivors: Single-Arm Feasibility Study BACKGROUND: Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) frequently experience disease-related symptoms and treatment adverse effects that impact their overall quality of life.

The Role of Antioxidants Supplementation in Clinical Practice: Focus on Cardiovascular Risk Factors,"Oxidative stress may be defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant system to counteract or detoxify these potentially damaging molecules. This phenomenon is a common feature of many human disorders, such as cardiovascular disease. Many of the risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and obesity, are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, involving an elevated oxidative stress burden (either due to enhanced ROS production or decreased antioxidant protection). There are many therapeutic options to treat oxidative stress-associated cardiovascular diseases. Numerous studies have focused on the utility of antioxidant supplementation. However, whether antioxidant supplementation has any preventive and/or therapeutic value in cardiovascular pathology is still a matter of debate. In this review, we provide a detailed description of oxidative stress biomarkers in several cardiovascular risk factors. We also discuss the clinical implications of the supplementation with several classes of antioxidants, and their potential role for protecting against cardiovascular risk factors.",0,"The Role of Antioxidants Supplementation in Clinical Practice: Focus on Cardiovascular Risk Factors Oxidative stress may be defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant system to counteract or detoxify these potentially damaging molecules.

Susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells to different viruses,"• BACKGROUND: Different viruses have been reported to be involved in retinal diseases in animalsystems. In humans, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have been found to cause retinal disease. Most of the studied viruses are neurotropic. In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEC) to representative members of different groups of human pathogenic viruses was investigated. • METHODS: Early cultures of RPE C — after two or three passages — were infected with the following viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus types 1 and 7, measles virus, parainfluenza virus and coxsackie virus B3. • RESULTS: Cultures of RPE C could be infected with neurotropic viruses like HSV or measles virus as well as with typical respiratory viruses like parainfluenza or adenoviruses. Coxsackievirus, an enterovirus, replicated as well as human CMV whereas EBV and HHV-6, two lymphotropic viruses, failed to infect RPE. • CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a variety of viruses, including those causing rather common illnesses, might be capable of inducing retinal lesions under certain circumstances due to haematogenous spread during the course of viraemia.",0,"Susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells to different viruses • BACKGROUND: Different viruses have been reported to be involved in retinal diseases in animalsystems.

Antibody-based therapeutic interventions: possible strategy to counter chikungunya viral infection,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted disease that belongs to the genus Alphaviruses, has been emerged as an epidemic threat over the last two decades, and the recent co-emergence of this virus along with other circulating arboviruses and comorbidities has influenced atypical mortality rate up to 10%. Genetic variation in the virus has resulted in its adaptability towards the new vector Aedes albopictus other than Aedes aegypti, which has widen the horizon of distribution towards non-tropical and non-endemic areas. As of now, no licensed vaccines or therapies are available against CHIKV; the treatment regimens for CHIKV are mostly symptomatic, based on the clinical manifestations. Development of small molecule drugs and neutralizing antibodies are potential alternatives of worth investigating until an efficient or safe vaccine is approved. Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in antiviral immunity, and their presence is a hallmark of viral infection. In this review, we describe prospects for effective vaccines and highlight importance of neutralizing antibody-based therapeutic and prophylactic applications to combat CHIKV infections. We further discuss about the progress made towards CHIKV therapeutic interventions as well as challenges and limitation associated with the vaccine development. Furthermore this review describes the lesson learned from chikungunya natural infection, which could help in better understanding for future development of antibody-based therapeutic measures.",0,"Antibody-based therapeutic interventions: possible strategy to counter chikungunya viral infection Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted disease that belongs to the genus Alphaviruses, has been emerged as an epidemic threat over the last two decades, and the recent co-emergence of this virus along with other circulating arboviruses and comorbidities has influenced atypical mortality rate up to 10%.

Developing a Transnational Health Record Framework with Level-Specific Interoperability Guidelines Based on a Related Literature Review,"With the advent of digital healthcare without borders, enormous amounts of health information are captured and computerized. As healthcare quality largely depends on the reliability of given health information, personal health records should be accessible according to patients’ mobility, even as they travel or migrate to other countries. However, since all the health information is scattered in multiple places, it is an onerous task to carry it whenever people move to other countries. To effectively and efficiently utilize health information, interoperability, which is the ability of various healthcare information technologies to exchange, to interpret, and to use data, is needed. Hence, building a robust transnational health information infrastructure with clear interoperability guidelines considering heterogeneous aspects is necessary. For this purpose, this study proposes a Transnational Health Record framework, which enables access to personal health records anywhere.

Anticipating the Species Jump: Surveillance for Emerging Viral Threats,"Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans. Are there ways to identify high-risk viruses before they emerge in humans? If so, then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods? These were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans. Virologists, ecologists and computational biologists from academia, federal government and non-governmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts, vectors and reservoirs. This workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability. Canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps. To answer the question of where to look, prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife, bats, rodents, arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed. Finally, opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps. Taken together, these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps.",0,"Anticipating the Species Jump: Surveillance for Emerging Viral Threats Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans.

Finally, opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps. Taken together, these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps.",anticipating the species jump surveillance for emerging viral threats zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans are there ways to identify highrisk viruses before they emerge in humans if so then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods these were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans virologists ecologists and computational biologists from academia federal government and nongovernmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts vectors and reservoirs this workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal h3n2 and pandemic h1n1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps to answer the question of where to look prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife bats rodents arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed finally opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps taken together these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps,1
Molecular and electrophysiological features of spinocerebellar ataxia type seven in induced pluripotent stem cells,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments.",0,"Molecular and electrophysiological features of spinocerebellar ataxia type seven in induced pluripotent stem cells Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene.

Further Evidence for Bias in Observational Studies of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness: The 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Pandemic,"Preinfluenza periods have been used to test for uncontrolled confounding in studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness, but some authors have claimed that confounding differs in preinfluenza and influenza periods. We tested this claim by comparing estimates of the vaccine-mortality association during the 2009/2010 influenza year, when there was essentially no circulation of seasonal influenza in the United States, and 2007/2008, a typical influenza year. We pooled data on seniors (adults aged ≥65 years) from 7 US managed care organizations that participated in the Vaccine Safety Datalink Project. We defined influenza vaccination, all-cause mortality, and potential confounders from administrative databases. We quantified the vaccine-mortality association using Cox regression. During 2007/2008, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.44 prior to influenza season, 0.62 during influenza season, and 0.71 after influenza season. A similar pattern was observed during 2009/2010, when any effect of seasonal influenza vaccine observed during all time periods must have resulted from confounding: 0.65 during the autumn, 0.80 during the winter, and 0.84 during the summer. In a year with minimal seasonal influenza, we found no evidence that confounding in autumn preinfluenza periods is qualitatively different from confounding in winter.

Human Polyclonal Antibodies Produced from Transchromosomal Bovine Provides Prophylactic and Therapeutic Protections Against Zika Virus Infection in STAT2 KO Syrian Hamsters,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can cause severe congenital diseases, such as microcephaly, ocular defects and arthrogryposis in fetuses, and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. Efficacious therapeutic treatments for infected patients, as well as prophylactic treatments to prevent new infections are needed for combating ZIKV infection. Here, we report that ZIKV-specific human polyclonal antibodies (SAB-155), elicited in transchromosomal bovine (TcB), provide significant protection from infection by ZIKV in STAT2 knockout (KO) golden Syrian hamsters both prophylactically and therapeutically. These antibodies also prevent testicular lesions in this hamster model. Our data indicate that antibody-mediated immunotherapy is effective in treating ZIKV infection. Because suitable quantities of highly potent human polyclonal antibodies can be quickly produced from the TcB system against ZIKV and have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a small animal model, they have the potential as an effective countermeasure against ZIKV infection.",0,"Human Polyclonal Antibodies Produced from Transchromosomal Bovine Provides Prophylactic and Therapeutic Protections Against Zika Virus Infection in STAT2 KO Syrian Hamsters Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can cause severe congenital diseases, such as microcephaly, ocular defects and arthrogryposis in fetuses, and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults.

Drug2ways: Reasoning over causal paths in biological networks for drug discovery,"Elucidating the causal mechanisms responsible for disease can reveal potential therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention and, accordingly, guide drug repositioning and discovery. In essence, the topology of a network can reveal the impact a drug candidate may have on a given biological state, leading the way for enhanced disease characterization and the design of advanced therapies. Network-based approaches, in particular, are highly suited for these purposes as they hold the capacity to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. Here, we present drug2ways, a novel methodology that leverages multimodal causal networks for predicting drug candidates. Drug2ways implements an efficient algorithm which reasons over causal paths in large-scale biological networks to propose drug candidates for a given disease. We validate our approach using clinical trial information and demonstrate how drug2ways can be used for multiple applications to identify: i) single-target drug candidates, ii) candidates with polypharmacological properties that can optimize multiple targets, and iii) candidates for combination therapy. Finally, we make drug2ways available to the scientific community as a Python package that enables conducting these applications on multiple standard network formats.",0,"Drug2ways: Reasoning over causal paths in biological networks for drug discovery Elucidating the causal mechanisms responsible for disease can reveal potential therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention and, accordingly, guide drug repositioning and discovery.

Interferon-γ Inhibits Ebola Virus Infection,"Ebola virus outbreaks, such as the 2014 Makona epidemic in West Africa, are episodic and deadly. Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available. Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option. Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection. As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication. Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes. Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection. These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection. As treatment of interferon gamma robustly protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, we propose that interferon gamma should be further evaluated for its efficacy as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategy against filoviruses. Use of this FDA-approved drug could rapidly be deployed during future outbreaks.",0,"Interferon-γ Inhibits Ebola Virus Infection Ebola virus outbreaks, such as the 2014 Makona epidemic in West Africa, are episodic and deadly.

The Association of Market Mix of Hospital Ownership With Medical Disputes: Evidence From China,"The prevalence and severity of medical disputes in China have attracted the attention of society and academia, and how to alleviate medical disputes has become a major concern. Following the implementation of a series of policies, the private sector in China’s hospital market has expanded rapidly over the past decade. It remains unknown whether the market mix of hospital ownership could alleviate medical disputes, this study aims to bridge the gap. Data are collected from all hospitals (2171) in Sichuan province, China, from 2012 to 2015. Using a negative binomial hurdle model, the results show that for hospitals with disputes, the private hospital market share has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the number of disputes. However, no significant relationship is found between the private hospital market share and the probability of dispute occurrence. For hospitals with disputes, competition plays a protective role in the effect of the private hospital market share on the number of disputes, hindering the increase in the number of disputes and facilitating a more rapid drop. However, medical quality is found to play an insignificant role in that effect. The findings also support encouraging new private hospitals in China rather than privatizing existing public hospitals.",0,"The Association of Market Mix of Hospital Ownership With Medical Disputes: Evidence From China The prevalence and severity of medical disputes in China have attracted the attention of society and academia, and how to alleviate medical disputes has become a major concern.

"Origin, Genetic Diversity, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Novel Porcine Circovirus 3","Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a novel virus associated with acute PDNS (porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome)‐like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine. Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single‐stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.",0,"Origin, Genetic Diversity, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Novel Porcine Circovirus 3 Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a novel virus associated with acute PDNS (porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome)‐like clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine.

A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single‐stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.",origin genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of novel porcine circovirus 3 porcine circovirus 3 pcv3 is a novel virus associated with acute pdns porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndromelike clinical signs identified by metagenomic sequencing from swine its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide the processes resulting in the emergence and spread of pcv3 remain poorly understood herein the possible origin genotypes and evolutionary dynamics of pcv3 based on available genomic sequences are determined the closest ancestor of pcv3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat cvs using different phylogenetic methods two major genotypes are identified pcv3a and pcv3b it is found that the effective population size of pcv3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of pcv3a and pcv3b a relatively high effective reproductive number re value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other singlestranded dna viruses and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 24 of orf2 is identified it is hypothesized that this together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320 might have allowed pcv3 to escape from the host immune response overall this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing pcv3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures,1
"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3′-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells","Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21- to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3′-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.",0,"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3′-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction.

A multi-omics supervised autoencoder for pan-cancer clinical outcome endpoints prediction,"BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, collecting diverse types of cancer omics data become more cost-effective. Many computational methods attempted to represent and fuse multiple omics into a comprehensive view of cancer. However, different types of omics are related and heterogeneous. Most of the existing methods do not consider the difference between omics, so the biological knowledge of individual omics may not be fully excavated. And for a given task (e.g. predicting overall survival), these methods prefer to use sample similarity or domain knowledge to learn a more reasonable representation of omics, but it’s not enough. METHODS: For the purpose of learning more useful representation for individual omics and fusing them to improve the prediction ability, we proposed an autoencoder-based method named MOSAE (Multi-omics Supervised Autoencoder). In our method, a specific autoencoder were designed for each omics according to their size of dimension to generate omics-specific representations. Then, a supervised autoencoder was constructed based on specific autoencoder by using labels to enforce each specific autoencoder to learn both omics-specific and task-specific representations. Finally, representations of different omics that generate from supervised autoencoders were fused in a traditional but powerful way, and the fused representation was used for subsequent predictive tasks. RESULTS: We applied our method over TCGA Pan-Cancer dataset to predict four different clinical outcome endpoints (OS, PFI, DFI, and DSS). Compared with traditional and state-of-the-art methods, MOSAE achieved better predictive performance. We also tested the effects of each improvement, which all have a positive effect on predictive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Predicting clinical outcome endpoints are very important for precision medicine and personalized medicine. And multi-omics fusion is an effective way to solve this problem. MOSAE is a powerful multi-omics fusion method, which can generate both omics-specific and task-specific representation for given endpoint predictive tasks and improve the predictive performance.",0,"A multi-omics supervised autoencoder for pan-cancer clinical outcome endpoints prediction BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, collecting diverse types of cancer omics data become more cost-effective.

Systemic hypoxia inhibits T cell response by limiting mitobiogenesis via matrix substrate-level phosphorylation arrest,"Systemic oxygen restriction (SOR) is prevalent in numerous clinical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections. However, the influence of SOR on T cell immunity remains uncharacterized. Here we show the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated mouse CD8(+) T cells. We find that low oxygen level diminishes CD8(+) T cell anti-viral response in vivo. We reveal that respiratory restriction inhibits ATP-dependent matrix processes that are critical for mitochondrial-biogenesis. This respiratory restriction-mediated effect could be rescued by TCA cycle re-stimulation, which yielded increased mitochondrial matrix-localized ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that the hypoxia-arrested CD8(+) T cell anti-viral response could be rescued in vivo through brief exposure to atmospheric oxygen pressure. Overall, these findings elucidate the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated CD8(+) T cells, and suggest a new approach for reducing viral infections in COPD.",0,"Systemic hypoxia inhibits T cell response by limiting mitobiogenesis via matrix substrate-level phosphorylation arrest Systemic oxygen restriction (SOR) is prevalent in numerous clinical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections.

Measles Virus as an Oncolytic Immunotherapy,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Measles virus is currently under investigation as an innovative cancer treatment. The virus selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. Furthermore, it can be genetically engineered to increase tumor specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, treatment with measles virus activates antitumor immune responses. A number of clinical trials using measles virus for cancer treatment have been completed or are ongoing. Future studies will further harness the possibilities of virus engineering and potential of combination immunotherapies to improve clinical outcome. ABSTRACT: Measles virus (MeV) preferentially replicates in malignant cells, leading to tumor lysis and priming of antitumor immunity. Live attenuated MeV vaccine strains are therefore under investigation as cancer therapeutics. The versatile MeV reverse genetics systems allows for engineering of advanced targeted, armed, and shielded oncolytic viral vectors. Therapeutic efficacy can further be enhanced by combination treatments. An emerging focus in this regard is combination immunotherapy, especially with immune checkpoint blockade. Despite challenges arising from antiviral immunity, availability of preclinical models, and GMP production, early clinical trials have demonstrated safety of oncolytic MeV and yielded promising efficacy data. Future clinical trials with engineered viruses, rational combination regimens, and comprehensive translational research programs will realize the potential of oncolytic immunotherapy.",0,"Measles Virus as an Oncolytic Immunotherapy SIMPLE SUMMARY: Measles virus is currently under investigation as an innovative cancer treatment.

Microarrays as Research Tools and Diagnostic Devices,"Molecular diagnostics comprises a main analytical division in clinical laboratory diagnostics. The analysis of RNA or DNA helps to diagnose infectious diseases and identify genetic determined disorders or even cancer.

Healthcare needs of vulnerable patient groups: available data and existing gaps in Germany with respect to long-term mechanical ventilation,"AIM: Long-term invasively ventilated patients exhibit exceptional and resource-intensive healthcare needs. However, major knowledge gaps in Germany complicate appropriate approaches to best address these demands. This paper evaluates available information on the patient group and their healthcare needs from German data sources and derives implications for healthcare planning and regulation by national/federal self-governing bodies, political decision-makers, and specialized providers. METHODS: Based on the concept of needs, we addressed the normative dimension typically characterized by epidemiological data. Based on existing German health system data resources, an explorative approach was utilized to identify and characterize available databases providing information on the patient group and/or their healthcare. RESULTS: To date, no available database provides information on the healthcare needs of this patient group. As of the reporting year 2017, the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) statistics will provide hospital-specific data on home invasive ventilation interventions, but the data do not provide information on long-term care. Claims data may be a promising source for cross-sectoral evaluation of healthcare needs but feature methodological challenges. These results call for efforts to address limited data eligibility, adopt a broader understanding of healthcare needs, and identify actions needed to evidence informed and needs-oriented healthcare. CONCLUSION: Future approaches on needs-oriented specialized healthcare should close the existing knowledge gap based on reliable data. In addition to normative information, they should consider subjective dimensions on a life course perspective and quantitative and qualitative service performance characteristics across multiple sectors and professions.",0,"Healthcare needs of vulnerable patient groups: available data and existing gaps in Germany with respect to long-term mechanical ventilation AIM: Long-term invasively ventilated patients exhibit exceptional and resource-intensive healthcare needs. However, major knowledge gaps in Germany complicate appropriate approaches to best address these demands. This paper evaluates available information on the patient group and their healthcare needs from German data sources and derives implications for healthcare planning and regulation by national/federal self-governing bodies, political decision-makers, and specialized providers. METHODS: Based on the concept of needs, we addressed the normative dimension typically characterized by epidemiological data. Based on existing German health system data resources, an explorative approach was utilized to identify and characterize available databases providing information on the patient group and/or their healthcare. RESULTS: To date, no available database provides information on the healthcare needs of this patient group. As of the reporting year 2017, the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) statistics will provide hospital-specific data on home invasive ventilation interventions, but the data do not provide information on long-term care.

Lipopolysaccharide and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibit Interferon Signaling in Hepatocytes by Increasing Ubiquitin-Like Protease 18 (USP18) Expression,"Inflammation may be maladaptive to the control of viral infection when it impairs interferon (IFN) responses, enhancing viral replication and spread. Dysregulated immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a hallmark of chronic viral infections such as, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that expression of an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), ubiquitin-like protease (USP)18 is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses to IFN-α. We examined the ability of inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 to upregulate hepatocyte USP18 expression and blunt the IFN-α response. Human hepatoma cells and primary murine hepatocytes were treated with TNF-α/LPS/IL-6/IL-10 and USP18, phosphorylated (p)-STAT1 and myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1) expression was determined. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells and primary murine hepatocytes with LPS and TNF-α, but not IL-6 or IL-10, led to upregulated USP18 expression and induced an IFN-α refractory state, which was reversed by USP18 knockdown. Liver inflammation was induced in vivo using a murine model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury led to an induction of USP18 expression in liver tissue and promotion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF-α and LPS) but not others (IL-6 and IL-10) target USP18 expression and thus inhibit IFN signaling. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states. IMPORTANCE Inflammation may prevent the control of viral infection when it impairs the innate immune response, enhancing viral replication and spread. Blunted immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a common characteristic of chronic viral infections. Previous studies have shown that expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses. In this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via USP18 induction.

Does the Type of Exposure to Workplace Violence Matter to Nurses’ Mental Health?,"Workplace violence is a prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, particularly among nursing professionals. Exposure to workplace violence may be direct through firsthand involvement, indirect through secondhand witnessing, or both. Even though implications for victims of workplace violence have been well-studied, less is known about the various types of exposure and their effects on nurse mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of workplace-violence exposure types on the mental health of nurses, while accounting for the intensity of the incident/s. This study employs an exploratory correlational design with survey methods. Nurses from British Columbia (BC), Canada, were invited by the provincial nurses’ union to complete an electronic survey in Fall 2019. A total of 2958 responses from direct-care nurses in acute-care settings were analyzed using logistic regression. The results showed that mental-health problems increased with cumulative exposure; even though nurses with solely indirect exposure to workplace violence did not report greater mental-health problems, those experiencing solely direct exposure, or both direct and indirect exposure, were two to four times more likely to report high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and burnout compared to their counterparts with no exposure. There is an urgent need for better mental-health support, prevention policies and practices that take into account the type of workplace-violence exposure.",0,"Does the Type of Exposure to Workplace Violence Matter to Nurses’ Mental Health?

Insights into the Evolution and Emergence of a Novel Infectious Disease,"Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1). Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if [Image: see text] or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.",0,"Insights into the Evolution and Emergence of a Novel Infectious Disease Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1).
