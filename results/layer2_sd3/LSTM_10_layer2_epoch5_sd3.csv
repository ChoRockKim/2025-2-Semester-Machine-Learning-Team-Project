Respiratory Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction: An Important Diagnostic Tool in Immunocompromised Patients,"

This paper examines the utility of respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (RMP) as an important diagnostic tool in immunocompromised patients. In recent years, the rate of severe immune deficiency disorders is increasing, leading to a higher prevalence of serious bacterial and viral infections among this population. As existing standard diagnostic tests are not sensitive enough to detect viruses or bacteria at low levels, they risk missing difficult-to-diagnose pathogens that can lead to life-threatening complications. RMP has emerged as a breakthrough technology within the medical field due to its accuracy and speed, allowing clinicians to quickly identify lower concentrations of numerous bacterial and viral genetic markers simultaneously in only a single sample. The current study discusses the use of RMP for diagnosing pathogen infections in immunocompromised individuals, making it an invaluable screening tool for early detection and improved patient care management.",1,"Respiratory Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction: An Important Diagnostic Tool in Immunocompromised Patients

The Effects of Frequency and Duration of Handling on the Development of Feline Upper Respiratory Infections in a Shelter Setting,"

 UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN A SHELTER SETTING: EFFECTS OF FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF HANDLING

Feline upper respiratory infections (URI) are one of the most common illnesses in cats and can have a significant impact both on individual animal health, as well as shelter population welfare. Focusing on understanding strategies to mitigate URI prevalence is of utmost importance in shelters; however, there is currently limited research exploring how frequency and duration of handling impacts the development of URI. To further elucidate this potential association, we conducted a prospective cohort study among cats residing at an open admission animal shelter over six months. During their stay in the facility, data regarding frequency and duration of health assessments were collected from medical records at daily intervals for each cat. Analysis sought to explore whether an increased number or length of handling events could predict increased odds for developing URI. This paper presents findings that suggest regular and frequent handling sessions might be beneficial for reducing adult feline’s risk for developing URIs when housed at overcrowded open-admission animal shelters with compromised ventilation systems",1,"The Effects of Frequency and Duration of Handling on the Development of Feline Upper Respiratory Infections in a Shelter Setting

Remote Postdischarge Treatment of Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction by Allied Health Care Practitioners vs Standard Care: The IMMACULATE Randomized Clinical Trial,"

Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a major form of coronary heart disease, affects millions of people worldwide. The hospital discharge process is critical for patient recovery and outcomes; however, effective post-discharge management to ensure healthcare continuity remains challenging. Studies have suggested that remote follow-up by allied health care practitioners may improve quality of care delivered during the inpatient period, yet there are limited data on comparative effectiveness between a standard approach and those with additional intervention from such specialists. 

Objective: To assess whether remote post-discharge AMI treatment provided by allied health care practitioners improves clinical outcomes when compared to standard treatments provided by generalists alone at 30 days after hospital discharge.  

Methods: The IMMACULATE trial (Improved Management after MyOcclusive Cardiac AcUUte LEsion Transitions) is an open label randomized controlled clinical trial designed to compare remote post-discharge follow up treatment provided entirely or partly through telehealth by allied health care practitioners vs traditional standardized medical management from primary/secondary outpatient centers in patients recently discharged following an acute myocardial infarction episode hospitalized within two weeks prior to recruitment.  Inclusion criteria consisted of all adult patients who had experienced an AMI presenting at one of the participating hospitals within 14 days prior to inclusion, documented left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, having current symptoms indicating continued need for symptom control in addition to drug regimen monitoring guideline adherence since initial presentation indicated persistent risk including further events and overall comorbidities stabilization attempts requiring follow up beyond discharge were also included while individuals receiving previous intensive stent revascularization therapies were excluded at baseline enrollment).

AMMACTLATE Randomized Clinical Trial: Comparing Effectiveness Of Remote Post Discharge Treatment By Allied Health Care Practitioners Vs Standard Care In Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction",1,"Remote Postdischarge Treatment of Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction by Allied Health Care Practitioners vs Standard Care: The IMMACULATE Randomized Clinical Trial 

Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a major form of coronary heart disease, affects millions of people worldwide. The hospital discharge process is critical for patient recovery and outcomes; however, effective post-discharge management to ensure healthcare continuity remains challenging. Studies have suggested that remote follow-up by allied health care practitioners may improve quality of care delivered during the inpatient period, yet there are limited data on comparative effectiveness between a standard approach and those with additional intervention from such specialists. 

Objective: To assess whether remote post-discharge AMI treatment provided by allied health care practitioners improves clinical outcomes when compared to standard treatments provided by generalists alone at 30 days after hospital discharge.  

Methods: The IMMACULATE trial (Improved Management after MyOcclusive Cardiac AcUUte LEsion Transitions) is an open label randomized controlled clinical trial designed to compare remote post-discharge follow up treatment provided entirely or partly through telehealth by allied health care practitioners vs traditional standardized medical management from primary/secondary outpatient centers in patients recently discharged following an acute myocardial infarction episode hospitalized within two weeks prior to recruitment.  Inclusion criteria consisted of all adult patients who had experienced an AMI presenting at one of the participating hospitals within 14 days prior to inclusion, documented left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, having current symptoms indicating continued need for symptom control in addition to drug regimen monitoring guideline adherence since initial presentation indicated persistent risk including further events and overall comorbidities stabilization attempts requiring follow up beyond discharge were also included while individuals receiving previous intensive stent revascularization therapies were excluded at baseline enrollment).   A total sample size was estimated based on power calculations using appropriate analytic techniques adjusted for any potential confounding variables; thus allowing direct effect estimation and confidence interval calculation as outcome analysis parameters upon completion analysis and study close out.

Cushing’s syndrome complicated by multiple opportunistic infections,"

This paper presents research on a case of Cushing’s Syndrome complicated by multiple opportunistic infections. Cushing's syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder in which cortisol levels are persistently elevated, resulting in systemic dysfunction that increases the risk for vulnerability to infectious agents. Despite prompt medical treatment and antimicrobial interventions, this patient experienced recurring bacterial and fungal infection recurrence over an extended period due to an impaired immune system caused by underlying diseases associated with Cushing's Syndrome. The purpose of this study was to explore the theoretical links between invasiveness of microbial agents and the prognostic outcome for patients suffering from Cushing’s Syndrome-related recurrent complications due to debilitating weakened immunity.",1,"Cushing’s syndrome complicated by multiple opportunistic infections
