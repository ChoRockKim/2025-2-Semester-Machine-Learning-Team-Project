A Novel Nutraceutical Formulation Can Improve Motor Activity and Decrease the Stress Level in a Murine Model of Middle-Age Animals,"Ageing is a genetically programmed physiological process that is modulated by numerous environmental factors, associated with decreasing physiological function, decreasing reproductive rate and increasing age-related mortality rate. Maintaining mobility performance and physical function in the elderly is the main objective of the successful ageing concept. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the beneficial effect of a novel nutraceutical formulation containing Centella asiatica L. extract, vitamin C, zinc and vitamin D3 (as cholecalciferol) on motor activity and anxiety with the use of a murine model of old animals, as a means of providing proof for clinical use in the elderly, for enhancing physical strength and improving life quality. Eighteen Sprague Dawley 18 months old male rats were divided into three groups and received corn oil (the control group) or 1 capsule/kg bw Reverse supplement (treatment group 1) or 2 capsules/kg bw Reverse supplement (treatment group 2), for a period of 3 months. The Reverse supplement (Natural Doctor S.A, Athens, Greece) contains 9 mg Centella asiatica L. extract, vitamin C (200 mg as magnesium ascorbate), zinc (5 mg as zinc citrate), vitamin D3 (50 µg as cholecalciferol) per capsule. Before and after the treatment, the motor function and behavioral changes for anxiety and depression were evaluated using the open-field test, elevated plus-maze test and rotarod test. The supplementation with Reverse (Natural Doctor S.A) supplement can improve the locomotor activity in old rats in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by an increase in the latency to leave from the middle square, in the number of rearings in the open field test, in the time spent in the open arms and time spent in the center in the elevated plus-maze test and the latency to all in all three consecutive trials in the rotarod test. Stress also decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner, following the treatment with Reverse supplement, as was demonstrated by the decrease in the number of groomings at the open field test and time spent in the dark and the number of groomings at the elevated plus-maze test.",0,"A Novel Nutraceutical Formulation Can Improve Motor Activity and Decrease the Stress Level in a Murine Model of Middle-Age Animals Ageing is a genetically programmed physiological process that is modulated by numerous environmental factors, associated with decreasing physiological function, decreasing reproductive rate and increasing age-related mortality rate.

Novel Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutic Tools for Livestock Diseases,"Recent novelties in diverse diagnostics and therapeutic tools in animal health sector have paved a brighter and clearer way ahead. These are proved to be better in detection, management, control and eradication of animal sufferings caused by various infectious and non-infectious diseases. These innovations have potential impact that extends beyond the animal health and welfare. The advancements have significantly contributed towards improvement in the economy of the country as well as food security. In the present competitive era of evolution, the organisms have inculcated a number of new strategies for survival and spread. Therefore, science needs to continuously evolve more sensitive, specific and high-throughput tools to overcome pathogen cleverness to escape from host immune surveillance. For visible or remarkable changes, it is necessary to use full potential of these advanced molecular techniques into current animal health standards and practices. Under ‘One Health’ concept, the health of animals and humans has to be taken care simultaneously. At present, these advanced molecular diagnostic methods play a significant role in the detection of new and emerging pathogens of livestock. The acquired information also helps to study the interrelationships of pathogens, their hosts and their surroundings. Additionally new vaccines bridging human and animal health development may be discovered. Latest developments in the field of diagnostics and vaccine design through genomics approach have also laid the foundation to enhance the diagnosis and surveillance and in turn helped in the control of infectious diseases. Latest high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms are currently being used for identification and detailed analysis of both disease pathogen and host genomes. The high-throughput data generated using these platforms need to be analysed adopting the bioinformatics and computational genomics that have taken a very high pace nowadays. In the context of animal health, the data analysis may provide some key opportunities for the development of better diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emerging or re-emerging diseases. Such novel and potent technologies put forward a significantly new scenario of disease knowledge, which enables more accurate predictions leading to faster and greater management responses to combat potentially devastating disease crises.",0,"Novel Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutic Tools for Livestock Diseases Recent novelties in diverse diagnostics and therapeutic tools in animal health sector have paved a brighter and clearer way ahead.

Intrapulmonary concentrations of meropenem administered by continuous infusion in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia: a randomized pharmacokinetic trial,"BACKGROUND: Optimal antimicrobial drug exposure in the lung is required for successful treatment outcomes for nosocomial pneumonia. Little is known about the intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem when administered by continuous infusion (CI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the PK of two dosages of meropenem (3 g vs 6 g/day by CI) in the plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS: Thirty-one patients (81% male, median (IQR) age 72 (22) years) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Sixteen patients received 1 g/8 h and 15 2 g/8 h by CI (8 h infusion). Plasma and ELF meropenem concentrations were modeled using a population methodology, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of attaining (PTA) a free ELF concentration of 50% of time above MIC (50% fT>MIC), which results in logarithmic killing and the suppression of resistance in experimental models of pneumonia. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of meropenem AUC(0–24 h) in the plasma and ELF was 287.6 (190.2) and 84.1 (78.8) mg h/L in the 1 g/8 h group vs 448.1 (231.8) and 163.0 (201.8) mg h/L in the 2 g/8 h group, respectively. The penetration ratio was approximately 30% and was comparable between the dosage groups. In the Monte Carlo simulations, only the highest approved dose of meropenem of 2 g/8 h by CI allowed to achieve an optimal PTA for all isolates with a MIC < 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the dose of meropenem administered by CI achieved a higher exposure in the plasma and ELF. The use of the highest licensed dose of 6 g/day may be necessary to achieve an optimal coverage in ELF for all susceptible isolates (MIC ≤ 2 mg/L) in patients with conserved renal function. An alternative therapy should be considered when the presence of microorganisms with a MIC greater than 2 mg/L is suspected. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT-no. 2016-002796-10).

Mitochondrial mutations restricting spontaneous translational frameshift suppression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"The +1 frameshift mutation, M5631, which is located in the gene (oxi1) for cytochrome c oxidase II (COXII) of the yeast mitochondrial genome, is suppressed spontaneously to a remarkably high extent (20%–30%). The full-length wild-type COXII produced as a result of suppression allows the mutant strain to grow with a “leaky” phenotype on non-fermentable medium. In order to elucidate the factors and interactions involved in this translational suppression, the strain with the frameshift mutation was mutated by MnCl(2) treatment and a large number of mutants showing restriction of the suppression were isolated. Of 20 mutants exhibiting a strong, restricted, respiration-deficient (RD) phenotype, 6 were identified as having mutations in the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, genetic analyses mapped one mutation to the vicinity of the gene for tRNA(Pro) and two others to a region of the tRNA cluster where two-thirds of all mitochondrial tRNA genes are encoded. The degree of restriction of the spontaneous frameshift suppression was characterized at the translational level by in vivo (35)S-labeling of the mitochondrial translational products and immunoblotting. These results showed that in some of these mutant strains the frameshift suppression product is synthesized to the same extent as in the leaky parent strain. It is suggested that more than one +1 frame-shifted product is made as a result of suppression in these strains: one is as functional as the wild-type COXII, the other(s) is (are) non-functional and prevent leaky growth on non-fermentable medium. A possible mechanism for this heterogenous frameshift suppression is discussed.",0,"Mitochondrial mutations restricting spontaneous translational frameshift suppression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae The +1 frameshift mutation, M5631, which is located in the gene (oxi1) for cytochrome c oxidase II (COXII) of the yeast mitochondrial genome, is suppressed spontaneously to a remarkably high extent (20%–30%).

Persistence of human parvovirus B19 in tissues from adult individuals: a comparison with serostatus and its clinical utility,"Human parvovirus B19 (PVB19) is linked to variety of diseases, including erythema infectiosum, transient aplastic crisis, fetal hydrops, cardiomyopathy and, recently, hepatitis and arthritis. Persistence of PVB19 in asymptomatic individuals has been reported in skin, synovium, myocardium and bone marrow. A higher level of PVB19 DNA has been observed in various tissues from cases of disease than in controls. Simultaneously, equal detection of PVB19 DNA has been shown in both cases and controls. Thus, it has become fundamental to study PVB19 DNA persistence in tissues that are unaffected by disease. This will help to better understand PVB19 DNA persistence in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and its possible pathogenic role in various diseases. A total of 70 adult autopsies were included and divided into seropositive (SP) and seronegative (SN) groups based on PVB19 IgG. Nested PCR for PVB19 DNA was carried out in myocardium, liver, kidney, and bone marrow. Of the 70 patients, 60 % belonged to the SP group and 40 % to the SN group. Seropositivity ranged from 50 % in the 12 to 20 year old group to 66.7 % in the 61 to 80 year old group. The viral genome was detected in 34.3 % of myocardium, 20 % of bone marrow, 10 % of kidney and 8.6 % of liver samples. There was no significant difference in the persistence rates between the SP and SN groups. The persistence of PVB19 DNA in various tissues ranged from 8.3 % to 36 % in the SP group and 10 % to 30 % in the SN group.

Calming Troubled Waters: A Narrative Review of Challenges and Potential Solutions in the Residency Interview Offer Process,"The rising numbers of residency applications along with fears of a constrained graduate medical education environment have created pressures on residency applicants. Anecdotal evidence suggests substantial challenges with the process of offering residency interviews. This narrative review is designed to identify and propose solutions for the current problems in the process of offering residency interviews. We used PubMed and web browser searches to identify relevant studies and reports. Materials were assessed for relevance to the current process of distributing residency interviews. There is limited relevant literature and the quality is poor overall. We were able to identify several key problem areas including uncertain timing of interview offers; disruption caused by the timing of interview offers; imbalance of interview offers and available positions; and a lack of clarity around waitlist and rejection status. In addition, the couples match and need for coordination of interviews creates a special case. Many of the problems related to residency interview offers are amenable to program-level interventions, which may serve as best practices for residency programs, focusing on clear communication of processes as well as attention to factors such as offer-timing and numbers. We provide potential strategies for programs as well as a call for additional research to better understand the problem and solutions.",0,"Calming Troubled Waters: A Narrative Review of Challenges and Potential Solutions in the Residency Interview Offer Process The rising numbers of residency applications along with fears of a constrained graduate medical education environment have created pressures on residency applicants.

In addition, the couples match and need for coordination of interviews creates a special case. Many of the problems related to residency interview offers are amenable to program-level interventions, which may serve as best practices for residency programs, focusing on clear communication of processes as well as attention to factors such as offer-timing and numbers.

"12 Intersectionality, Structural Vulnerability, and Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Services: Filipina Domestic Workers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Qatar","In this chapter the experiences of Filipina domestic workers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Qatar are examined in the framework of their structural vulnerability to health problems. The chapter shows how their poor state of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) can be the outcome of a combination of forms of institutional discrimination that are interconnected and should be investigated in respect of: (a) the worth of their ‘identity’ (migrant, female, the work they do); (b) the distinct aspects of discourse on sexuality and normativity which specifically relate to their presence in the destination countries; and (c) ideational and material realities constraining their own agency in finding adequate care. The chapter shows how variations in the potential for access may be explained by the types and degree of their structural vulnerability regarding labour rights, their relationship with employers and migrants’ associations, and their personal SRH awareness–together with what emerges from cooperation between those government officials and civil society organizations who work with migrant domestic workers. Attentiveness to the particular combination of forms of institutional discrimination in a given cultural and institutional context, especially the ways in which the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Filipina domestic workers are linked to the ways in which labour migration are organized, should be helpful for effective SRH advocacy.",0,"12 Intersectionality, Structural Vulnerability, and Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Services: Filipina Domestic Workers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Qatar In this chapter the experiences of Filipina domestic workers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Qatar are examined in the framework of their structural vulnerability to health problems.

Combined Rosiglitazone and Forskolin Have Neuroprotective Effects in SD Rats after Spinal Cord Injury,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist rosiglitazone inhibits NF-κB expression and endogenous neural stem cell differentiation into neurons and reduces the inflammatory cascade after spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying rosiglitazone-mediated neuroprotective effects and regulation of the balance between the inflammatory cascade and generation of endogenous spinal cord neurons by using a spinal cord-derived neural stem cell culture system as well as SD rat SCI model. Activation of PPAR-γ could promote neural stem cell proliferation and inhibit PKA expression and neuronal formation in vitro. In the SD rat SCI model, the rosiglitazone + forskolin group showed better locomotor recovery compared to the rosiglitazone and forskolin groups. MAP2 expression was higher in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the rosiglitazone group, NF-κB expression was lower in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the forskolin group, and NeuN expression was higher in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the forskolin group.

Promising Trends in Access to Medicines,"It is a vast understatement to say that the problem of access to medicines in developing countries is complex. Access is limited by a range of factors including inability to pay, a lack of infrastructure, and corruption in some countries. Surrounding and exacerbating these structural and technological problems is the layer of legal rights created by patents and their licensing that complicate and render more expensive the preparation and delivery of needed medicines, particularly those that need to be adapted to the social, health and cultural environment of developing countries. This article provides a survey of innovative strategies that aim at maximizing the potential of patents to facilitate the development and delivery of medicines against diseases, the burden of which falls principally on developing country populations. To understand the context in which these strategies are being proposed and implemented, the article reviews the battles over access to medicines beginning in the late 1980s. It then surveys some of the principal suggestions put forward to better direct innovation systems in addressing the critical health needs of the world’s majority including advance market commitments, patent buy‐outs, prize funds, public–private partnerships and patent pools.",0,"Promising Trends in Access to Medicines It is a vast understatement to say that the problem of access to medicines in developing countries is complex.

In Silico Analysis Reveals Sequential Interactions and Protein Conformational Changes during the Binding of Chemokine CXCL-8 to Its Receptor CXCR1,"Chemokine CXCL-8 plays a central role in human immune response by binding to and activate its cognate receptor CXCR1, a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. The full-length structure of CXCR1 is modeled by combining the structures of previous NMR experiments with those from homology modeling. Molecular docking is performed to search favorable binding sites of monomeric and dimeric CXCL-8 with CXCR1 and a mutated form of it. The receptor-ligand complex is embedded into a lipid bilayer and used in multi ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A multi-steps binding mode is proposed: (i) the N-loop of CXCL-8 initially binds to the N-terminal domain of receptor CXCR1 driven predominantly by electrostatic interactions; (ii) hydrophobic interactions allow the N-terminal Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif of CXCL-8 to move closer to the extracellular loops of CXCR1; (iii) electrostatic interactions finally dominate the interaction between the N-terminal ELR motif of CXCL-8 and the EC-loops of CXCR1. Mutation of CXCR1 abrogates this mode of binding. The detailed binding process may help to facilitate the discovery of agonists and antagonists for rational drug design.",0,"In Silico Analysis Reveals Sequential Interactions and Protein Conformational Changes during the Binding of Chemokine CXCL-8 to Its Receptor CXCR1 Chemokine CXCL-8 plays a central role in human immune response by binding to and activate its cognate receptor CXCR1, a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family.

Porcine parvovirus nonstructural protein NS1 activates NF-κB and it involves TLR2 signaling pathway,"BACKGROUND: Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that causes porcine reproductive failure. It is of critical importance to study PPV pathogenesis for the prevention and control of the disease. NS1, a PPV non-structural protein, is participated in viral DNA replication, transcriptional regulation, and cytotoxicity. Our previous research showed that PPV can activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and then up-regulate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6. OBJECTIVES: Herein, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the non-structural protein NS1 of PPV also has the same function. METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot, immunofluorescence assay and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that PPV NS1 protein can up-regulate the expression levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PPV NS1 protein was found to induce the phosphorylation of IκBα, then leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In addition, the NS1 protein activated the upstream pathways of NF-κB. Meanwhile, TLR2-siRNA assay showed TLR2 plays an important role in the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway induced by PPV-NS1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that PPV NS1 protein induced the up-regulated of IL-6 expression through activating the TLR2 and NF-κB signaling pathways.

Early interactions between animal viruses and the host cell: relevance to viral vaccines,"Viral recognition of specific receptors in the host cell plasma membrane is the first step in virus infection. Attachment is followed by a redistribution or capping of virus particles on the cell surface which may play a role in the uptake process. Certain viruses penetrate the plasma membrane directly but many, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, are endocytosed at coated pits and subsequently pass into endosomes. The low pH environment of the endosome facilitates passage of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For some viruses the mechanism of membrane penetration is now known to be linked to a pH-mediated conformational change in external virion proteins. As a consequence of infection there are alterations in the permeability of the plasma membrane which may contribute to cellular damage. Recent advances in the understanding of these processes are reviewed and their relevance to the development of new strategies for vaccines emphasised.",0,"Early interactions between animal viruses and the host cell: relevance to viral vaccines Viral recognition of specific receptors in the host cell plasma membrane is the first step in virus infection.

Comparative Serological Assays for the Study of H5 and H7 Avian Influenza Viruses,"The nature of influenza virus to randomly mutate and evolve into new types is an important challenge in the control of influenza infection. It is necessary to monitor virus evolution for a better understanding of the pandemic risk posed by certain variants as evidenced by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. This has been clearly recognized in Egypt following the notification of the first HPAI H5N1 outbreak. The continuous circulation of the virus and the mass vaccination programme undertaken in poultry have resulted in a progressive genetic evolution and a significant antigenic drift near the major antigenic sites. In order to establish if vaccination is sufficient to provide significant intra- and interclade cross-protection, lentiviral pseudotypes derived from H5N1 HPAI viruses (A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/chicken/Egypt-1709-01/2007) and an antigenic drift variant (A/chicken/Egypt-1709-06-2008) were constructed and used in pseudotype-based neutralization assays (pp-NT). pp-NT data obtained was confirmed and correlated with HI and MN assays. A panel of pseudotypes belonging to influenza Groups 1 and 2, with a combination of reporter systems, was also employed for testing avian sera in order to support further application of pp-NT as an alternative valid assay that can improve avian vaccination efficacy testing, vaccine virus selection, and the reliability of reference sera.",0,"Comparative Serological Assays for the Study of H5 and H7 Avian Influenza Viruses The nature of influenza virus to randomly mutate and evolve into new types is an important challenge in the control of influenza infection.

A panel of pseudotypes belonging to influenza Groups 1 and 2, with a combination of reporter systems, was also employed for testing avian sera in order to support further application of pp-NT as an alternative valid assay that can improve avian vaccination efficacy testing, vaccine virus selection, and the reliability of reference sera.",comparative serological assays for the study of h5 and h7 avian influenza viruses the nature of influenza virus to randomly mutate and evolve into new types is an important challenge in the control of influenza infection it is necessary to monitor virus evolution for a better understanding of the pandemic risk posed by certain variants as evidenced by the highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai viruses this has been clearly recognized in egypt following the notification of the first hpai h5n1 outbreak the continuous circulation of the virus and the mass vaccination programme undertaken in poultry have resulted in a progressive genetic evolution and a significant antigenic drift near the major antigenic sites in order to establish if vaccination is sufficient to provide significant intra and interclade crossprotection lentiviral pseudotypes derived from h5n1 hpai viruses avietnam119404 achickenegypt1709012007 and an antigenic drift variant achickenegypt1709062008 were constructed and used in pseudotypebased neutralization assays ppnt ppnt data obtained was confirmed and correlated with hi and mn assays a panel of pseudotypes belonging to influenza groups 1 and 2 with a combination of reporter systems was also employed for testing avian sera in order to support further application of ppnt as an alternative valid assay that can improve avian vaccination efficacy testing vaccine virus selection and the reliability of reference sera,0
Fabry disease pain: patient and preclinical parallels,"Severe neuropathic pain is a hallmark of Fabry disease, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in lysosomal α-galactosidase A. Pain experienced by these patients significantly impacts their quality of life and ability to perform everyday tasks. Patients with Fabry disease suffer from peripheral neuropathy, sensory abnormalities, acute pain crises, and lifelong ongoing pain. Although treatment of pain through medication and enzyme replacement therapy exists, pain persists in many of these patients. Some has been learned in the past decades regarding clinical manifestations of pain in Fabry disease and the pathological effects of α-galactosidase A insufficiency in neurons. Still, it is unclear how pain and sensory abnormalities arise in patients with Fabry disease and how these can be targeted with therapeutics. Our knowledge is limited in part due to the lack of adequate preclinical models to study the disease. This review will detail the types of pain, sensory abnormalities, influence of demographics on pain, and current strategies to treat pain experienced by patients with Fabry disease. In addition, we discuss the current knowledge of Fabry pain pathogenesis and which aspects of the disease preclinical models accurately recapitulate. Understanding the commonalities and divergences between humans and preclinical models can be used to further interrogate mechanisms causing the pain and sensory abnormalities as well as advance development of the next generation of therapeutics to treat pain in patients with Fabry disease.",0,"Fabry disease pain: patient and preclinical parallels Severe neuropathic pain is a hallmark of Fabry disease, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in lysosomal α-galactosidase A.

Wildlife Trade and the Emergence of Infectious Diseases,"Most recent emerging infectious diseases have been zoonotic in origin. It is our contention that one of the factors responsible for such emergence is the trade in wildlife and bushmeat in particular. This article considers the effect of increasing diversity in the species hunted on the probability of global epidemics such as SARS. In particular, we develop a mathematical model of the probability of such an outbreak in terms of the number of species hunted, the number of susceptibles, and the rate of contact. Hence, we postulate that local biodiversity loss and increasing rates of animal trafficking, and trade and transportation of animals to large cities—where there is a greater potential for person-to-person transmission—may increase the probability of such outbreaks dramatically.",0,"Wildlife Trade and the Emergence of Infectious Diseases Most recent emerging infectious diseases have been zoonotic in origin.

Clinical Pharmacological and Therapeutic Considerations in General Intensive Care: A Review,"The application of clinical pharmacological concepts and therapeutic standards in intensive care settings presents particularly difficult problems due to the lack of adequately controlled background information and the highly variable and rapidly evolving clinical conditions where drugs must be administered and their impact evaluated. In this review, an attempt has been made to discuss the available knowledge within the framework of a problem-oriented approach, which appears to provide a more clinically useful insight than a drug-centred review. Following a brief discussion of the scanty data and the most interesting models to which reference can be made from a pharmacokinetic point of view (the burn patient being taken as an example), the review concentrates on the main general intervention strategies in intensive care patients. These are based mainly on non-pharmacological measures (correction of fluid and electrolyte balance, total parenteral nutrition, enterai nutrition, oxygenation and ventilatory management) and are discussed with respect to the specific challenge they present in various clinical conditions and organ failure situations. In addition, 4 major selected clinical conditions where general management criteria and careful use of prophylactic and therapeutic drug treatments must interact to cope with the variety of presentations and problems are reviewed. These include: acute cerebral damage; anti-infective prophylaxis and therapy; cardiovascular emergencies; and problems of haemostasis. Each problem is analysed in such a way as to frame the pharmacological intervention in its broader context of the underlying (established or hypothesised) pathophysiology, with special attention being paid to those methodological issues which allow an appreciation of the degree of reliability of the data and the recommendations which appear to be practiced (often haphazardly) in intensive care units. The thorough review of the published literature provided (up to mid-1986) clearly shows that in this field the quality of randomised controlled and epidemiological studies is rather unsatisfactory. It would be highly beneficial to research and to clinical care if larger multicentric protocols and prospective epidemiological comparative investigations could be carried out to investigate more timely and adequately the variables which determine drug action, and the final outcome in the many subgroups of patients which must be considered in a proper stratification of intensive care unit populations.",0,"Clinical Pharmacological and Therapeutic Considerations in General Intensive Care: A Review The application of clinical pharmacological concepts and therapeutic standards in intensive care settings presents particularly difficult problems due to the lack of adequately controlled background information and the highly variable and rapidly evolving clinical conditions where drugs must be administered and their impact evaluated.

"Modernities, Sciences, and Democracy","The “modern” in “modern science” is a relatively uninterrogated and untheorized concept within the sciences and in the philosophy, sociology, and history of science. This is so today at a time when other aspects of Western sciences have been fruitfully explored in critical and illuminating ways (see Christensen and Hansen, Chap. 13; and Skovsmose, Chap. 15). In particular, the exceptionalism and triumphalism characteristic of Western attitudes toward our sciences have been explicitly criticized and purportedly abandoned by many of the scholars working in science studies fields. By exceptionalism is meant the belief that Western sciences alone among all human knowledge systems are capable of grasping reality in its own terms—that these alone have the resources to escape the human tendency to project onto nature cultural assumptions, fears, and desires. By triumphalism is meant the assumption that the history of science consists of a history of achievements — that this history has no significant downsides. According to this view, Hiroshima, environmental destruction, the alienation of labour, escalating global militarism, the increasing gap between the “haves” and the ”have nots,” gender, race, and class inequalities — these and other undesirable social situations are all entirely consequences of social and political projects, to which the history of Western sciences makes no contribution. Such conventional Euro centric assumptions can no longer gather the support either in the West or elsewhere that they could once claim In recent decades a huge amount of literature on modernity has emerged from the social sciences and humanities. Stimulated by the massive shifts in local and global social formations during the last half of the Twentieth Century, and by the post-modern response to such changes, social theorists, literary and other cultural critics, and, especially, historians have debated the uneven and complex origins, nature, and desirable futures of modernity, modernization, and modernism. Such controversies about modernity are first and foremost about a culture's relation to its past and its possible futures. They arise as ways of asking what went wrong, and what needs to be corrected. The last half a century has witnessed the global decline and fall of belief in the unquestionably legitimate authority of the white, bourgeois, male.

Feasibility and safety of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors: results of a single-center study,"We compared the outcomes in patients receiving unrelated peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT) with those receiving bone marrow transplants (BMT) in a matched pair analysis. Seventy-four patients with hematological malignancies with HLA-matched (77%) and mismatched (23%) donors were analyzed in this study. Thirty-four patients (45%) were considered as high risk patients. Sixty-eight patients received standard conditioning regimens with Bu/Cy or TBI/Cy. Six patients received an intensified conditioning regimen with the addition of etoposide, thiotepa or melphalan. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of prednisolone, cyclosporine and methotrexate. Groups were matched for patient, donor, transplant characteristics and HLA compatibility. Peripheral blood stem cell collection led to the collection of a higher number of CD34(+) and CD3(+) cells in comparison to bone marrow collection. Leukocyte engraftment in the PBSCT group occurred in 14 days (median; range 6–26 days) and in the BMT group in 19 days (range 9–29 days; P < 0.02). The time of platelet engraftment did not differ significantly. The incidence of grades II–lV acute GVHD in the group of HLA-identical patients was 35% in the PBSCT group and 25% in the BMT group (P < 0.33, log-rank). However, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05, log-rank) in incidence and time to onset of acute GVHD II–IV comparing all patients, including the 17 mismatched transplants. Disease-free survival was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days for PBSC and BMT transplants, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT led to significantly faster leukocyte engraftment but is associated with a higher incidence and more rapid onset of severe acute GVHD comparing all patients, including the 17 mismatched transplants. However, the incidence of severe acute GVHD in HLA-identical patients was not different between the PBSCT and BMT groups.

"Lessons from Pandemic H1N1 2009 to Improve Prevention, Detection, and Response to Influenza Pandemics from a One Health Perspective","In April 2009, a novel influenza A subtype H1N1 triple reassortant virus (novel H1N1 2009), composed of genes from swine, avian, and human influenza A viruses, emerged in humans in the United States and Mexico and spread person-to-person around the world to become the first influenza pandemic of the 21(st) century. The virus is believed to have emerged from a reassortment event involving a swine virus some time in the past 10 to 20 years, but pigs, pork, and pork products have not been involved with infection or spread of the virus to or among people. Because countries quickly implemented recently developed pandemic influenza plans, the disease was detected and reported and public health authorities instituted control measures in a timely fashion. But the news media's unfortunate and inappropriate naming of the disease as the “swine flu” led to a drop in the demand for pork and several countries banned pork imports from affected countries, resulting in serious negative economic impacts on the pork industry. With the continual circulation and interspecies transmission of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses in countries around the world, there are calls for strengthening influenza surveillance in pigs, birds, and other animals to aid in monitoring and assessing the risk of future pandemic virus emergence involving different species.

The virus is believed to have emerged from a reassortment event involving a swine virus some time in the past 10 to 20 years, but pigs, pork, and pork products have not been involved with infection or spread of the virus to or among people. Because countries quickly implemented recently developed pandemic influenza plans, the disease was detected and reported and public health authorities instituted control measures in a timely fashion. But the news media's unfortunate and inappropriate naming of the disease as the “swine flu” led to a drop in the demand for pork and several countries banned pork imports from affected countries, resulting in serious negative economic impacts on the pork industry.

Decorating the surface of Escherichia coli with bacterial lipoproteins: a comparative analysis of different display systems,"BACKGROUND: The display of recombinant proteins on cell surfaces has a plethora of applications including vaccine development, screening of peptide libraries, whole-cell biocatalysts and biosensor development for diagnostic, industrial or environmental purposes. In the last decades, a wide variety of surface display systems have been developed for the exposure of recombinant proteins on the surface of Escherichia coli, such as autotransporters and outer membrane proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we assess three approaches for the surface display of a panel of heterologous and homologous mature lipoproteins in E. coli: four from Neisseria meningitidis and four from the host strain that are known to be localised in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. Constructs were made carrying the sequences coding for eight mature lipoproteins, each fused to the delivery portion of three different systems: the autotransporter adhesin involved in diffuse adherence-I (AIDA-I) from enteropathogenic E. coli, the Lpp’OmpA chimaera and a truncated form of the ice nucleation protein (INP), InaK-NC (N-terminal domain fused with C-terminal one) from Pseudomonas syringae. In contrast to what was observed for the INP constructs, when fused to the AIDA-I or Lpp’OmpA, most of the mature lipoproteins were displayed on the bacterial surface both at 37 and 25 °C as demonstrated by FACS analysis, confocal and transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study that compares surface display systems using a number of passenger proteins. We have shown that the experimental conditions, including the choice of the carrier protein and the growth temperature, play an important role in the translocation of mature lipoproteins onto the bacterial surface. Despite all the optimization steps performed with the InaK-NC anchor motif, surface exposure of the passenger proteins used in this study was not achieved. For our experimental conditions, Lpp’OmpA chimaera has proved to be an efficient surface display system for the homologous passenger proteins although cell lysis and phenotype heterogeneity were observed. Finally, AIDA-I was found to be the best surface display system for mature lipoproteins (especially heterologous ones) in the E. coli host strain with no inhibition of growth and only limited phenotype heterogeneity.",0,"Decorating the surface of Escherichia coli with bacterial lipoproteins: a comparative analysis of different display systems BACKGROUND: The display of recombinant proteins on cell surfaces has a plethora of applications including vaccine development, screening of peptide libraries, whole-cell biocatalysts and biosensor development for diagnostic, industrial or environmental purposes.

A contour‐based topographic model for hydrological and ecological applications,"A digital model for discretizing three‐dimensional terrain into small irregularly shaped polygons or elements based on contour lines and their orthogonals is described. From this subdivision the model estimates a number of topographic attributes for each element including the total upslope contributing area, element area, slope, and aspect. This form of discretization of a catchment produces natural units for problems involving water flow as either a surface or subsurface flow phenomenon. The model therefore has wide potential application for representing the three‐dimensionality of natural terrain and water flow processes in the fields of hydrology, sedimentology, and geomorphology. Three example applications are presented and discussed. They are the prediction of zones of surface saturation, the prediction of the distribution of potential daily solar radiation, and the prediction of zones of erosion and deposition in a catchment.",0,"A contour‐based topographic model for hydrological and ecological applications A digital model for discretizing three‐dimensional terrain into small irregularly shaped polygons or elements based on contour lines and their orthogonals is described.

Focus on Translation Initiation of the HIV-1 mRNAs,"To replicate and disseminate, viruses need to manipulate and modify the cellular machinery for their own benefit. We are interested in translation, which is one of the key steps of gene expression and viruses that have developed several strategies to hijack the ribosomal complex. The type 1 human immunodeficiency virus is a good paradigm to understand the great diversity of translational control. Indeed, scanning, leaky scanning, internal ribosome entry sites, and adenosine methylation are used by ribosomes to translate spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs, and some require specific cellular factors, such as the DDX3 helicase, that mediate mRNA export and translation. In addition, some viral and cellular proteins, including the HIV-1 Tat protein, also regulate protein synthesis through targeting the protein kinase PKR, which once activated, is able to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α, which results in the inhibition of cellular mRNAs translation. Finally, the infection alters the integrity of several cellular proteins, including initiation factors, that directly or indirectly regulates translation events. In this review, we will provide a global overview of the current situation of how the HIV-1 mRNAs interact with the host cellular environment to produce viral proteins.",0,"Focus on Translation Initiation of the HIV-1 mRNAs To replicate and disseminate, viruses need to manipulate and modify the cellular machinery for their own benefit.

Detection of gyrA and parC Mutations and Prevalence of Plasmid-Mediated Quinolone Resistance Genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recently, the extensive use of quinolones led to increased resistance to these antimicrobial agents, with different rates according to the organism and the geographical region. The aim of this study was to detect the resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae Iraqi isolates toward quinolone antimicrobial agents, to determine genetic mutations in gyrA and parC, to screen for efflux-pump activity, and to screen the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. METHODS: Forty-three K. pneumoniae isolates were confirmed phenotypically and genotypically by Vitek 2 system and species specific primers by PCR using the targeting rpo gene followed by sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out using disc diffusion method. Quinolone resistant isolates were subjected to ciprofloxacin MIC testing, and cartwheel method to screen for efflux pump activity. The presence of the plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes qepA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6)Ib was tested by PCR. Sequencing of gyrA and parC was performed. RESULTS: We observed a high rate of resistance to ceftriaxone, gentamicin ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. Low rate of resistance was detected against amikacin and azithromycin. Ciprofloxacin MIC results revealed that 96.1% of the isolates had MICs >256 µg/mL, 83.4% had MICs >512 µg/mL while 34.6% had MIC >1024 µg/mL. Testing of isolates against ciprofloxacin mixed with EtBr at various concentrations resulted in decreased resistant. Sequencing results showed that Ser83Leu was the most common mutation in gyrA that was observed in all quinolone resistant isolates, followed by Asp87Asn. Ser80Ile mutation in parC was observed in 77.7% of the tested isolates. The prevalence of PMQR genes was 92.5% aac (6)-Ib, 51.8% qnrB, 40.7% qepA, and 37% qnrS. CONCLUSION: Quinolone resistance is common in K. pneumoniae isolates in Baghdad.

Physical rehabilitation financing in Iran: a policy analysis using Kingdon’s multiple streams,"BACKGROUND: Adequate financing is a crucial function, securing that physical rehabilitation services (i.e., physiotherapy, occupational therapy, prosthetics and orthotics) are available with no financial hardship. Like many other countries, despite the adoption of various policies and strategies in recent decades, Iran enjoys no desirable physical rehabilitation financing (PRF). Accordingly, this qualitative study aimed to explore the PRF-related strategies and issues as well as their impacts on relevant policies in Iran. METHODS: An analysis of PRF-related policies was conducted in Iran using semi-structured interviews and policy documents review. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were employed to select key informants, including health-policy makers, civil society, rehabilitation-policy makers, university professors, and practitioners. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the collected data. The analysis was framed within Kingdon’s multiple streams. RESULTS: The hindering factors for desirable financing were weak insurance coverage, lack of sustainable financial resources, fragmented financing, lack of split between provider and financer, high-cost of physical rehabilitation services, low engagement of relevant experts in policy-making processes, and corrupt activities. In the policy stream, the following factors were highlighted: involvement of sustainable financial resources, the use of external revenue sources, allocated resources’ earmarking, the integration of the current funds to have better pooling, the use of incentive and timely payment mechanisms, the implementation of strategic purchasing principals, and the employment of effective rationing strategies. Moreover, parliament support, changes in administrations, international effects, pressures from interest campaigns and NGOs, and international sanctions were found as factors affecting the politics stream. CONCLUSION: The study findings revealed that a variety of national and international factors affect PRF-related issues in Iran. The recently enacted laws indicate that the PRF policies have already been on the national health political agenda.

Broad spectrum antiviral activity for paramyxoviruses is modulated by biophysical properties of fusion inhibitory peptides,"Human paramyxoviruses include global causes of lower respiratory disease like the parainfluenza viruses, as well as agents of lethal encephalitis like Nipah virus. Infection is initiated by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes. Paramyxovirus viral fusion proteins (F) insert into the target cell membrane, and form a transient intermediate that pulls the viral and cell membranes together as two heptad-repeat regions refold to form a six-helix bundle structure that can be specifically targeted by fusion-inhibitory peptides. Antiviral potency can be improved by sequence modification and lipid conjugation, and by adding linkers between the protein and lipid components. We exploit the uniquely broad spectrum antiviral activity of a parainfluenza F-derived peptide sequence that inhibits both parainfluenza and Nipah viruses, to investigate the influence of peptide orientation and intervening linker length on the peptides’ interaction with transitional states of F, solubility, membrane insertion kinetics, and protease sensitivity. We assessed the impact of these features on biodistribution and antiviral efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The engineering approach based on biophysical parameters resulted in a peptide that is a highly effective inhibitor of both paramyxoviruses and a set of criteria to be used for engineering broad spectrum antivirals for emerging paramyxoviruses.",0,"Broad spectrum antiviral activity for paramyxoviruses is modulated by biophysical properties of fusion inhibitory peptides Human paramyxoviruses include global causes of lower respiratory disease like the parainfluenza viruses, as well as agents of lethal encephalitis like Nipah virus.

BiP/GRP78 Mediates ERAD Targeting of Proteins Produced by Membrane-Bound Ribosomes Stalled at the STOP-Codon,"Translational stalling of ribosome bound to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane requires an accurate clearance of the associated polypeptides, which is not completely understood in mammals. We characterized in mammalian cells the model of ribosomal stalling at the STOP-codon based on proteins tagged at the C-terminus with the picornavirus 2A peptide followed by a termination codon instead of the Proline (2A*). We exploited the 2A* stalling model to characterize the pathway of degradation of ER-targeted polypeptides. We report that the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 is a new main factor involved.

We characterized in mammalian cells the model of ribosomal stalling at the STOP-codon based on proteins tagged at the C-terminus with the picornavirus 2A peptide followed by a termination codon instead of the Proline (2A*). We exploited the 2A* stalling model to characterize the pathway of degradation of ER-targeted polypeptides. We report that the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 is a new main factor involved.

"The General Composition of the Faecal Virome of Pigs Depends on Age, but Not on Feeding with a Probiotic Bacterium","BACKGROUND: The pig faecal virome, which comprises the community of viruses present in pig faeces, is complex and consists of pig viruses, bacteriophages, transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species. Only little is known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not. RESULTS: From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55–77%) in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8–10%) in the samples of the sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22–44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and “circovirus-like” viruses CB-A and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group. CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method.",0,"The General Composition of the Faecal Virome of Pigs Depends on Age, but Not on Feeding with a Probiotic Bacterium BACKGROUND: The pig faecal virome, which comprises the community of viruses present in pig faeces, is complex and consists of pig viruses, bacteriophages, transiently passaged plant viruses and other minor virus species.

China vs the WHO: a behavioural norm conflict in the SARS crisis,"This article studies a conflict over two competing norms in which the actors demonstrated incompatible positions not through arguments, but through actions. During the SARS crisis, China and the World Health Organization (WHO) entered a norm conflict over the precedence of sovereignty or global health security. Both resorted to behavioural, not discursive contestation: while the WHO practically but not rhetorically challenged the sovereignty norm by acting according to the norm of global health security, China—without openly acknowledging it—contravened the basic principles of global health security by acting according to the overlapping sovereignty norm. Why and with what consequences do actors choose to contest norms through actions rather than words? The article accounts for the resort to behavioural contestation by pointing to the strategic advantages it offers for furthering a contentious norm understanding without facing the social costs of making it explicit. It furthermore highlights that behavioural contestation may feed back into and change the odds of discursive contestation as its practical effects provide rhetorical resources to (de-)legitimate one or the other position. The propositions are illustrated in the interactions of China and the WHO during the SARS crisis and the subsequent norm development.

Spatial Epidemic Modelling in Social Networks,"The spread of infectious diseases is highly influenced by the structure of the underlying social network.

In the movement model, some assumptions are made about its structure and the daily movement is decomposed into four types: neighborhood, intra region, inter region and random. The model is Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based, and uses real data to define its geometry.

First detection of spring viraemia of carp virus in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) affected by a septicaemic disease in Mexico,"Spring viraemia of carp (SVC) is an infectious disease responsible for severe economic losses for various cyprinid species, particularly common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio). The causative agent is the SVC virus (SVCV), a member of the Sprivivirus genus, Rhabdoviridae family, and a List 1 pathogen notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health. This study describes the diagnosis of an SVCV pathogen isolated in October 2015 from wild common carp inhabiting a natural lagoon in central Mexico. While neither an epidemic nor fish mortalities were reported, the collected killed specimens exhibited clinical signs of disease (e.g., exopthalmia, moderate abdominal distension and haemorrhaging, as well as internal haemorrhages and adhesions). Histological results of injuries were consistent with the pathology caused by SVCV. This finding was supported by the isolation of a virus in EPC and BF‐2 cells and subsequent RT‐PCR confirmation of SVCV. The phylogenetic analyses of partial SVCV glycoprotein gene sequences classified the isolates into the Ia genogroup. These findings make this the first report of SVCV detection in Mexico, extending the southern geographical range of SVCV within North America. However, since this pathogen was detected in fish inhabiting a natural body of water without tributaries or effluents, it is difficult to estimate the risk of SVCV for other wild/feral cohabitating cyprinid species in the lagoon. The status of this virus is also unknown for other bodies of water within this region.",0,"First detection of spring viraemia of carp virus in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) affected by a septicaemic disease in Mexico Spring viraemia of carp (SVC) is an infectious disease responsible for severe economic losses for various cyprinid species, particularly common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio).

Globalization and blood safety,"Globalization may be viewed as the growing interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of cross‐border transactions in goods and services, and also through the more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology. Globalization is not just an economic phenomenon, although it is frequently described as such, but includes commerce, disease and travel, and immigration, and as such it affects blood safety and supply in various ways. The relatively short travel times offered by modern aviation can result in the rapid spread of blood‐borne pathogens before measures to counteract transmission can be put in place; this would have happened with SARS if the basic life cycle of the SARS virus did not include an asymptomatic viraemia. This risk can be amplified by ecological factors which effect the spread of these pathogens once they are transferred to a naïve ecosystem, as happened with West Nile virus (WNV) in North America. The rationalization and contraction of the plasma products industry may be viewed as one aspect of globalization imposed by the remorseless inevitability of the market; the effect of this development on the safety and supply of products has yet to be seen, but the oversight and assurance of a shrinking number of players will present particular challenges. Similarly, the monopolization of technology, through patent enforcement which puts access beyond the reach of developing countries, can have an effect on blood safety. The challenges presented to blood safety by globalization are heightening the tensions between the traditional focus on the product safety – zero‐risk paradigm and the need to view the delivery of safe blood as an integrated process. As an illustration of this tension, donor deferral measures imposed by globalization‐induced risks such as vCJD and WNV have resulted in the loss of the safest and most committed portion of the blood donor population in many Western countries, leading to an increased risk to safety and supply. It is only through an appreciation of the basic needs of transfusion medicine, including the enunciation of appropriate principles to manage, rather than eliminate, risks, that the challenges imposed by globalization may be overcome.",0,"Globalization and blood safety Globalization may be viewed as the growing interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of cross‐border transactions in goods and services, and also through the more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology.

Effective Catheter Manoeuvre for the Removal of Phlegm by Suctioning: A Biomechanical Analysis of Experts and Novices,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the effective biomechanical technique for suctioning phlegm. METHODS: A novel tracheal suctioning simulator combined with a motion capture system was used to calculate the amount of simulated phlegm suctioned and the biomechanical parameters of the associated suctioning manoeuvre. A laboratory study, including 12 nurses with > 3 years of suctioning experience and 12 nursing students without any clinical suctioning experience, was conducted. The amount of phlegm suctioned, the maximum length of catheter insertion, and the biomechanical parameters of hand movement were calculated. RESULTS: The mean amount of phlegm suctioned per second was significantly larger in the experienced group than in the non-experienced group. The amount of phlegm suctioned correlated positively with the length of the vertical path of motion of the wrist and forearm, and with the angular velocity of thumb rotation in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Greater vertical motion of the wrist and thumb rotation improved the effectiveness of phlegm suctioning and prevented the need for deep suctioning, which is unsafe.",0,"Effective Catheter Manoeuvre for the Removal of Phlegm by Suctioning: A Biomechanical Analysis of Experts and Novices PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the effective biomechanical technique for suctioning phlegm.

Cap structures of the type m(7) GpppN(m)pN(m)p are present at the 5′ ends of nearly all eukaryotic cellular and viral mRNAs. A cap is added to cellular mRNA precursors and to the transcripts of viruses that replicate in the nucleus during the initial phases of transcription and before other processing events, including internal N(6)A methylation, 3′-poly (A) addition, and exon splicing. Despite the variations on the methylation theme, the important biological consequences of a cap structure appear to correlate with the N(7)-methyl on the 5′-terminal G and the two pyrophosphoryl bonds that connect m(7)G in a 5′–5′ configuration to the first nucleotide of mRNA. In addition to elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of capping and the downstream effects of this 5′- modification on gene expression, the advent of gene cloning has made available an ever-increasing amount of information on the proteins responsible for producing caps and the functional effects of other cap-related interactions. Genetic approaches have demonstrated the lethal consequences of cap failure in yeasts, and complementation studies have shown the evolutionary functional conservation of capping from unicellular to metazoan organisms.",0,"Viral and cellular mRNA capping: Past and prospects This chapter focuses on the history of the discovery of cap and an update of research on viral and cellular-messenger RNA (mRNA) capping.

Improving Accuracy and Timeliness of Nursing Documentation of Pediatric Early Warning Scores,"INTRODUCTION: Accurate and timely documentation of pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) by the bedside nurse into the electronic health record (EHR) is important to promote early identification of patients in stages of deterioration. Through the implementation of a PEWS calculator embedded in the EHR, we hope to improve the accuracy of the recorded score and reduce the time between vital sign collection and final documentation in the EHR. METHODS: Identification of the highest PEWS value in the 24 hours before all unplanned transfers or rapid response activations without a transfer occurred between the period November 1, 2013, through December 31, 2016. The accuracy of the calculated cardiac or respiratory subscore based on heart rate or the respiratory rate at the time of PEWS calculation was determined. We tracked the calculation of the time to chart via the difference between nursing documentation of PEWS compared to vital sign collection. Before September 3, 2015, PEWS was calculated mentally by the bedside nurse; afterward, the nurse entered the unique PEWS features into the EHR, and the EHR automatically calculated PEWS. RESULTS: This study evaluated 2,409 PEWS scores, 1,411 before and 998 after initiation of the PEWS calculator. Accuracy before the EHR calculator was 71%, and the median time to document was 55 minutes. Following the implementation of the calculator, no scores were incorrectly calculated too low, and the median time to document was 20 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Transition to an EHR-based PEWS calculator eliminated inaccurately low PEWS values and reduced time to document.",0,"Improving Accuracy and Timeliness of Nursing Documentation of Pediatric Early Warning Scores INTRODUCTION: Accurate and timely documentation of pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) by the bedside nurse into the electronic health record (EHR) is important to promote early identification of patients in stages of deterioration.

Thylakoid protein phosphorylation in evolutionally divergent species with oxygenic photosynthesis,"Phosphothreonine antibody was used to explore reversible thylakoid protein phosphorylation in vivo in evolutionally divergent organisms with oxygenic photosynthesis. Three distinct groups of organisms were found. Cyanobacteria and red algae, both with phycobilisome antenna system, did not show phosphorylation of any of the photosystem II (PSII) proteins and belong to group 1. Group 2 species, consisting of a moss, a liverwort and a fern, phosphorylated both the light‐harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins (LHCII) and the PSII core proteins D2 and CP43, but not the D1 protein. Reversible phosphorylation of the D1 protein seems to be the latest event in the evolution of PSII protein phosphorylation and was found only in seed plants, in group 3 species. Light‐intensity‐dependent regulation of LHCII protein phosphorylation was similar in group 2 and 3 species, with maximal phosphorylation of LHCII at low light and nearly complete dephosphorylation at high light.",0,"Thylakoid protein phosphorylation in evolutionally divergent species with oxygenic photosynthesis Phosphothreonine antibody was used to explore reversible thylakoid protein phosphorylation in vivo in evolutionally divergent organisms with oxygenic photosynthesis.

The Mutational Robustness of Influenza A Virus,"A virus’ mutational robustness is described in terms of the strength and distribution of the mutational fitness effects, or MFE. The distribution of MFE is central to many questions in evolutionary theory and is a key parameter in models of molecular evolution. Here we define the mutational fitness effects in influenza A virus by generating 128 viruses, each with a single nucleotide mutation. In contrast to mutational scanning approaches, this strategy allowed us to unambiguously assign fitness values to individual mutations. The presence of each desired mutation and the absence of additional mutations were verified by next generation sequencing of each stock. A mutation was considered lethal only after we failed to rescue virus in three independent transfections. We measured the fitness of each viable mutant relative to the wild type by quantitative RT-PCR following direct competition on A549 cells. We found that 31.6% of the mutations in the genome-wide dataset were lethal and that the lethal fraction did not differ appreciably between the HA- and NA-encoding segments and the rest of the genome. Of the viable mutants, the fitness mean and standard deviation were 0.80 and 0.22 in the genome-wide dataset and best modeled as a beta distribution. The fitness impact of mutation was marginally lower in the segments coding for HA and NA (0.88 ± 0.16) than in the other 6 segments (0.78 ± 0.24), and their respective beta distributions had slightly different shape parameters. The results for influenza A virus are remarkably similar to our own analysis of CirSeq-derived fitness values from poliovirus and previously published data from other small, single stranded DNA and RNA viruses. These data suggest that genome size, and not nucleic acid type or mode of replication, is the main determinant of viral mutational fitness effects.",0,"The Mutational Robustness of Influenza A Virus A virus’ mutational robustness is described in terms of the strength and distribution of the mutational fitness effects, or MFE.

Listening to the neurological teams for multiple sclerosis: the SMART project,"OBJECTIVE: Aim of the research was to define the quality of life of Italian neurologists and nurses’ professional caring for multiple sclerosis, to understand their living the clinical practice and identify possible signals of compassion fatigue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred five neurologists and nurses from 30 Italian multiple sclerosis centres were involved in an online quali-quantitative survey on the organization of care, combined with the Satisfaction and Compassion Fatigue Test and a collection of narratives. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative data were integrated with the results obtained by the narrative medicine methods of analysis. RESULTS: Most of the practitioners were neurologists, 46 average years old, 69% women, 43% part time dedicated to multiple sclerosis. An increased number of patients in the last 3 years were referred in 29 centres. Differences were found between neurologists and nurses. Physicians showed higher risks of burnout, reporting intensive working paces, lack of medical personnel, and anxiety caused by the precarious employment conditions. Nurses appeared more satisfied, although the reference to the lack of spaces, and the cross professional roles risk of compassion fatigue. Both positive and negative relationships of care were depicted as influencing the professional quality of life. CONCLUSION: The interviewed neurological teams need to limit the risk of compassion fatigue, which appeared from the first years of the career. The prevalence of the risk among neurologists suggests more awareness among scientific societies and health care managers on the risk for this category, as first step to prevent it.

"Acceptability of community quarantine in contexts of communicable disease epidemics: perspectives of literate lay people living in Conakry, Guinea","During the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, some communities reacted hostilely to the implementation of quarantine measures. This study's aim was to examine the views of lay people in Guinea on the acceptability of community quarantine. From June to August 2016, 302 adults indicated the acceptability of quarantine in 36 scenarios varying as a function of four factors: the infectious disease's level of contagiousness, its level of lethality, the number of cases in the community and whether persons in quarantine are provided with support services. Five clusters were identified: (1) for 18% of the participants, quarantine is never acceptable; (2) 16% considered, in contrast, that quarantine is always acceptable; (3) for 14%, it depends on the disease's level of contagiousness and lethality; (4) 36% based their judgement not only on the levels of contagiousness and lethality, but also on whether those in quarantine are provided with support services; and (5) 16% had no opinion. Interventions to increase voluntary compliance with community quarantine in Guinea must not be ‘one size fits all’, but must be multifaceted and tailored in design and implementation to match the diversity of people's concerns and needs.",0,"Acceptability of community quarantine in contexts of communicable disease epidemics: perspectives of literate lay people living in Conakry, Guinea During the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, some communities reacted hostilely to the implementation of quarantine measures.

Enlightened Self-interest in Altruism (ESIA),"Altruism and the medical profession have been linked throughout the history of medicine. Students are drawn to the calling of medicine because of altruistic values, dedication to service, and the desire to alleviate suffering and promote healing. Despite a dedication to these values, altruism in medicine is threatened by empathy erosion that develops in the clinical years of medical school and an increasing rate of medical student burnout. Currently, there are two widespread movements in medicine aimed at addressing the dual loss of altruism and physician and student burnout—professionalism and wellness. Despite widespread recognition of the problems and programs aimed at improving them, there has been little headway, and even calls to abandon altruism in the modern marketplace of medicine. What is needed is not an abandonment of a fundamental, defining value of the profession, but a re-evaluation of the meaning of altruism in medicine and a framework that allows for students and physicians to provide altruistic care for a sustainable, rewarding career in the healing profession. This paper proposes the Enlightened Self-Interest in Altruism (ESIA) model as an ethical framework to allow medical students to synergize the interests of the self with those they serve in a mutually beneficial relationship to improve patient care and the healthcare system at large. The ESIA model acknowledges that egoism and altruism are intertwined, dynamic motivators of behavior. In the enlightened self-interest approach, the interests of the group are also the interests of the self. The physician–patient relationship is a dyad in which egoism and altruism may converge in an enlightened way that acknowledges that the interests of one are the interests of the whole. This is a paradigm shift from the historical view of egoism and altruism as opposing motivations. This paper will present the threats to altruism, explore the interface of egoism and altruism in a clinical vignette, and then present the ESIA framework as an educational approach to aligning the interests of providers and patients to prevent burnout and promote altruism.",0,"Enlightened Self-interest in Altruism (ESIA) Altruism and the medical profession have been linked throughout the history of medicine.

They are able to influence the surface tension of the gas–liquid interface specifically by directly interacting with single lipids. This work describes the generation of reliable protein structure models to support the experimental characterization of two novel putative surfactant proteins called SP-G and SP-H. The obtained protein models were complemented by predicted posttranslational modifications and placed in a lipid model system mimicking the pulmonary surface. Molecular dynamics simulations of these protein-lipid systems showed the stability of the protein models and the formation of interactions between protein surface and lipid head groups on an atomic scale. Thereby, interaction interface and strength seem to be dependent on orientation and posttranslational modification of the protein. The here presented modeling was fundamental for experimental localization studies and the simulations showed that SP-G and SP-H are theoretically able to interact with lipid systems and thus are members of the surfactant protein family.

Periarteriolar stroma cells guide T cells from the red to the white pulp in the spleen,"While both the spleen and lymph nodes are called secondary lymphoid tissues, how lymphocytes enter these tissues are quite different from each other. This is because the architecture of the two types of organs and the mode of lymphocyte migration into these organs are quite distinct. In the spleen, T cells are passively released in the blood flow from the arterioles in the red pulp and marginal zone area. In contrast, T cells in the blood are actively captured on high endothelial venules in lymph nodes by the coordinated actions of CCR7 and several adhesion molecules. A recent finding indicates that T cells, released in the red pulp and marginal zone areas, actively find their way to the white zone by utilizing the migration track created by periarteriolar stromal cells. This finding adds one more piece to our understanding of lymphocyte migration for effective adaptive immune responses in the spleen.",0,"Periarteriolar stroma cells guide T cells from the red to the white pulp in the spleen While both the spleen and lymph nodes are called secondary lymphoid tissues, how lymphocytes enter these tissues are quite different from each other.

Assessment of the Evolution of Cancer Treatment Therapies,"Cancer therapy has been characterized throughout history by ups and downs, not only due to the ineffectiveness of treatments and side effects, but also by hope and the reality of complete remission and cure in many cases. Within the therapeutic arsenal, alongside surgery in the case of solid tumors, are the antitumor drugs and radiation that have been the treatment of choice in some instances. In recent years, immunotherapy has become an important therapeutic alternative, and is now the first choice in many cases. Nanotechnology has recently arrived on the scene, offering nanostructures as new therapeutic alternatives for controlled drug delivery, for combining imaging and treatment, applying hyperthermia, and providing directed target therapy, among others. These therapies can be applied either alone or in combination with other components (antibodies, peptides, folic acid, etc.). In addition, gene therapy is also offering promising new methods for treatment. Here, we present a review of the evolution of cancer treatments, starting with chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and immunotherapy, and moving on to the most promising cutting-edge therapies (gene therapy and nanomedicine). We offer an historical point of view that covers the arrival of these therapies to clinical practice and the market, and the promises and challenges they present.",0,"Assessment of the Evolution of Cancer Treatment Therapies Cancer therapy has been characterized throughout history by ups and downs, not only due to the ineffectiveness of treatments and side effects, but also by hope and the reality of complete remission and cure in many cases.

Co-electrospun nanofibrous mats loaded with bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) extract as the wound dressing materials: in vitro and in vivo study,"BACKGROUND: Interactive dressings are innovatively designed to interact with the wound surface and alter the wound environment to promote wound healing. In the current study, we integrated the physicochemical properties of Poly (caprolactone)/ Poly (vinyl alcohol)/Collagen (PCL/PVA/Col) nanofibers with the biological activities of Momordica charantia pulp extract to develop an efficient wound dressing. The electrospinning method was applied to fabricate the nanofibers, and the prepared wound dressings were thoroughly characterized. RESULTS: SEM imaging showed that the nanofibers were uniform, straight, without any beds with a diameter in the range of 260 to 480 nm. Increasing the concentration of the extract increased the diameter of the nanofibers and also the wettability characteristics while reduced the ultimate tensile strength from 4.37 ± 0.90 MPa for PCL/PVA/Col to 1.62 ± 0.50 MPa for PCL/PVA/Col/Ex 10% (p < 0.05). The in vivo studies showed that the application of the wound dressings significantly enhanced the healing process and the highest wound closure, 94.01 ± 8.12%, was obtained by PCL/PVA/Col/Ex 10% nanofibers (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The incorporation of the extract had no significant effects on nanofibers’ porosity, water vapor permeability, and swelling characteristics. The in vitro evaluations showed that the fabricated nanofibers were hemocompatible, cytocompatible, and prevent bacterial penetration through the dressing. These findings implied that the PCL/PVA/Col/Ex nanofibers can be applied as the wound dressing materials.",0,"Co-electrospun nanofibrous mats loaded with bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) extract as the wound dressing materials: in vitro and in vivo study BACKGROUND: Interactive dressings are innovatively designed to interact with the wound surface and alter the wound environment to promote wound healing.

"Genetic characterization of a novel recombinant echovirus 30 strain causing a regional epidemic of aseptic meningitis in Hokkaido, Japan, 2017","A regional epidemic of aseptic meningitis caused by echovirus 30 (E30) occurred in Hokkaido, Japan, during the period of August-December 2017. To investigate their phylogenetic relationship to other human enteroviruses, we determined the complete genomic nucleotide sequences of isolates from this outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral capsid protein 1 gene showed that the strains were most closely related to E30 strains detected in Germany, France, and Russia in 2013. In contrast, the region encoding the viral protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase had a close phylogenetic relationship to non-E30 enteroviruses detected in the United Kingdom and Switzerland in 2015-2017, suggesting that a recombination event had occurred.

Natural Pig Plasma Immunoglobulins Have Anti-Bacterial Effects: Potential for Use as Feed Supplement for Treatment of Intestinal Infections in Pigs,"There is an increasing demand for non-antibiotics solutions to control infectious disease in intensive pig production. Here, one such alternative, namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production. A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in >85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4+ challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity. Conclusively, our data support the idea that natural IgG directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of PWD and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known.",0,"Natural Pig Plasma Immunoglobulins Have Anti-Bacterial Effects: Potential for Use as Feed Supplement for Treatment of Intestinal Infections in Pigs There is an increasing demand for non-antibiotics solutions to control infectious disease in intensive pig production.

"An appraisal of oriental theileriosis and the Theileria orientalis complex, with an emphasis on diagnosis and genetic characterisation","Oriental theileriosis, a tick-borne disease of bovids caused by members of the Theileria orientalis complex, has a worldwide distribution. Globally, at least 11 distinct genotypes of T. orientalis complex, including type 1 (chitose), type 2 (ikeda), type 3 (buffeli), types 4 to 8, and N1–N3, have been described based on the sequence of the major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) gene. Of these 11 genotypes, mainly ikeda and chitose are known to be pathogenic and cause considerable morbidity (including high fever, anaemia, jaundice and abortion), production losses and/or mortality in cattle. Mixed infections with two or more genotypes of T. orientalis is common, but do not always lead to a clinical disease, posing challenges in the diagnosis of asymptomatic or subclinical forms of oriental theileriosis. The diagnosis of oriental theileriosis is usually based on clinical signs, the detection of piroplasms of T. orientalis in blood smears, and/or the use of serological or molecular techniques.

"Diet-Derived Antioxidants and Their Role in Inflammation, Obesity and Gut Microbiota Modulation","It is generally accepted that gut microbiota, inflammation and obesity are linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic/non-communicable pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and ageing-related disorders. In this scenario, oxidative stress plays a pivotal role. Evidence suggests that the global dietary patterns may represent a tool in counteracting oxidative stress, thus preventing the onset of diseases related to oxidative stress. More specifically, dietary patterns based on the regular consumption of fruits and vegetables (i.e., Mediterranean diet) have been licensed by various national nutritional guidelines in many countries for their health-promoting effects. Such patterns, indeed, result in being rich in specific components, such as fiber, minerals, vitamins and antioxidants, whose beneficial effects on human health have been widely reported. This suggests a potential nutraceutical power of specific dietary components. In this manuscript, we summarize the most relevant evidence reporting the impact of dietary antioxidants on gut microbiota composition, inflammation and obesity, and we underline that antioxidants are implicated in a complex interplay between gut microbiota, inflammation and obesity, thus suggesting their possible role in the development and modulation of chronic diseases related to oxidative stress and in the maintenance of wellness.

A multidisciplinary quality improvement effort to reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia incidence,"BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is the most common prematurity complication. Although several practices have been proposed for BPD prevention, none of these in isolation prevent BPD. METHODS: Our initiative focused on two key drivers: oxygen management and noninvasive ventilation strategies. We created best practice guidelines and followed outcome measures using Shewhart control charts. RESULTS: PDSAs of protocols preceded a large-scale rollout of a “0.21 by 28” campaign in 2014 leading to a special cause reduction in the “any BPD” rate, and a decrease in severe BPD (from 57 to 29%). At the end of 2017, we reinvigorated the project, which led to dramatic decreases in the “any BPD” rate to 41% and the “severe BPD” rate to 21%.

Glycosylation of dengue virus glycoproteins and their interactions with carbohydrate receptors: possible targets for antiviral therapy,"Dengue virus, an RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, affects 50 million individuals annually, and approximately 500,000–1,000,000 of these infections lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. With no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatments available to prevent dengue infection, dengue is considered a major public health problem in subtropical and tropical regions. The virus, like other enveloped viruses, uses the host’s cellular enzymes to synthesize its structural (C, E, and prM/M) and nonstructural proteins (NS1–5) and, subsequently, to glycosylate these proteins to produce complete and functional glycoproteins. The structural glycoproteins, specifically the E protein, are known to interact with the host’s carbohydrate receptors through the viral proteins’ N-glycosylation sites and thus mediate the viral invasion of cells. This review focuses on the involvement of dengue glycoproteins in the course of infection and the virus’ exploitation of the host’s glycans, especially the interactions between host receptors and carbohydrate moieties. We also discuss the recent developments in antiviral therapies that target these processes and interactions, focusing specifically on the use of carbohydrate-binding agents derived from plants, commonly known as lectins, to inhibit the progression of infection.",0,"Glycosylation of dengue virus glycoproteins and their interactions with carbohydrate receptors: possible targets for antiviral therapy Dengue virus, an RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, affects 50 million individuals annually, and approximately 500,000–1,000,000 of these infections lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.

Clinical review: Update of avian influenza A infections in humans,"Influenza A viruses have a wide host range for infection, from wild waterfowl to poultry to humans. Recently, the cross-species transmission of avian influenza A, particularly subtype H5N1, has highlighted the importance of the non-human subtypes and their incidence in the human population has increased over the past decade. During cross-species transmission, human disease can range from the asymptomatic to mild conjunctivitis to fulminant pneumonia and death. With these cases, however, the risk for genetic change and development of a novel virus increases, heightening the need for public health and hospital measures.

Effects of in vivo Soluble Selectin Gene Introduction on LPS-Induced Leukocyte Accumulation in the Murine Lung,"The selectin family adhesion molecules exert a crucial role in accumulation of leukocytes at the site of inflammation. To test the biological effects of soluble selectin on lung inflammation, we introduced an expression plasmid vector of soluble selectin gene via HVJ-liposome into a murine model of LPS-induced lung injury. The myeloperoxidase activity in LPS-injected mice was suppressed by the in vivo injection of soluble P-selectin gene relative to control mice. On the contrary, soluble E- or L-selectin genes did not exert suppressive effects. Our observations suggest that P-selectin plays a crucial role in the initial steps of lung inflammation, and exogenous introduction of soluble P-selectin by in vivo gene transfer method may be a useful strategy for regulating inflammation of the lung.",0,"Effects of in vivo Soluble Selectin Gene Introduction on LPS-Induced Leukocyte Accumulation in the Murine Lung The selectin family adhesion molecules exert a crucial role in accumulation of leukocytes at the site of inflammation.

"Genomic analysis of codon usage shows influence of mutation pressure, natural selection, and host features on Marburg virus evolution","BACKGROUND: The Marburg virus (MARV) has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, belongs to the family Filoviridae, and is responsible for several outbreaks of highly fatal hemorrhagic fever. Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus. RESULTS: Nucleotide composition and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed that MARV shows mutation bias and prefers U- and A-ended codons to code amino acids. Effective number of codons analysis indicated that overall codon usage among MARV genomes is slightly biased. The Parity Rule 2 plot analysis showed that GC and AU nucleotides were not used proportionally which accounts for the presence of natural selection. Codon usage patterns of MARV were also found to be influenced by its hosts. This indicates that MARV have evolved codon usage patterns that are specific to both of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from R. aegyptiacus on the MARV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from H. sapiens. Overall, mutation pressure was found to be the most important and dominant force that shapes codon usage patterns in MARV. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed codon usage analysis of MARV and extends our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to codon usage and evolution of MARV.

Biosynthesis of lanthionine-constrained agonists of G protein-coupled receptors,"The conformation with which natural agonistic peptides interact with G protein-coupled receptor(s) (GPCR(s)) partly results from intramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bridges or is induced by ligand–receptor interactions. The conformational freedom of a peptide can be constrained by intramolecular cross-links. Conformational constraints enhance the receptor specificity, may lead to biased activity and confer proteolytic resistance to peptidic GPCR agonists. Chemical synthesis allows to introduce a variety of cross-links into a peptide and is suitable for bulk production of relatively simple lead peptides. Lanthionines are thioether bridged alanines of which the two alanines can be introduced at different distances in chosen positions in a peptide. Thioether bridges are much more stable than disulfide bridges. Biosynthesis of lanthionine-constrained peptides exploiting engineered Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria that contain lanthionine-introducing enzymes constitutes a convenient method for discovery of lanthionine-stabilized GPCR agonists. The presence of an N-terminal leader peptide enables dehydratases to dehydrate serines and threonines in the peptide of interest after which a cyclase can couple the formed dehydroamino acids to cysteines forming (methyl)lanthionines. The leader peptide also guides the export of the formed lanthionine-containing precursor peptide out of Gram-positive bacteria via a lanthipeptide transporter. An engineered cleavage site in the C-terminus of the leader peptide allows to cleave off the leader peptide yielding the modified peptide of interest. Lanthipeptide GPCR agonists are an emerging class of therapeutics of which a few examples have demonstrated high efficacy in animal models of a variety of diseases.

Anti-viral activity of Zingiber officinale (Ginger) ingredients against the Chikungunya virus,"Chikungunya is one of the highly infectious viral disease without vaccine and anti-viral. Aim of present study is to check the anti-chikungunya activities of Zingiber officinale (Ginger) in the animal cell culture model. The medicinal plant extract was prepared from Z. officinale rhizome. Median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of Z. officinale extract was determined in Vero cell-line on the basis of cell viability followed by MTT assay. In vitro anti-chikungunya activity was performed in Vero cell-line with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale medicinal plant extract. The anti-viral effect of Z. officinale was studied by observing the cytopathic effects and cell viability measured by MTT assay. Maximum non-toxic dose of Z. officinale plant extract was found 62.5 μg/ml. During anti-chikungunya experimentation, cell viability increased to 51.05% and 35.10%, when Vero cells were pre-treated with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale extract respectively. Similarly, in co-treatment, when MNTD, half of MNTD of Z. officinale and Median tissue culture infective dose CHIKV were inoculated simultaneously, then the viability of Vero cell-line was increases by 52.90% and 49.02% respectively.

Critical Illness Stress-induced Immune Suppression,"Despite the use of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended practices to minimize infection risk, nosocomial sepsis and multiple organ failure (MOF) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. It is well documented that the use of immunosuppressant therapies dramatically increases this risk in patients with cancer, transplantation, and immunologic disease. Although immune monitoring has yet to be universally embraced, withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapies and use of immune restoration therapies is the standard of care when these patients develop sepsis. Critical illness stress can also induce a level of immunosuppression which is as life-threatening as is seen in the purposefully immunosuppressed patient. This chapter reviews the role of critical illness stress-induced immunosuppression in the development of nosocomial sepsis and MOF, and outlines clinical strategies which can be employed to maintain and restore immune function, and reduce morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.",0,"Critical Illness Stress-induced Immune Suppression Despite the use of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended practices to minimize infection risk, nosocomial sepsis and multiple organ failure (MOF) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

Such forecasts, if proven reliable, would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time. It is within this context that the Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of WNV. This simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory (e.g. province, state) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20 000 or smaller. RESULTS: After setting some hypotheses, a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes (genus Culex) and American crows, which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation. Based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics, an operational prototype was developed for the Southern part of Quebec (Canada). The system allows users to modify the parameters of the model, to select various climate and larviciding scenarios, to visualize on a digital map the progression (on a weekly or daily basis) of the infection in and around the crows' roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations. The basic units for visualisation are municipalities. CONCLUSION: In all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision-making related to WNV vector control measures, including the use of larvicides, according to climatic scenarios. Once fully calibrated in several real-life contexts, this promising approach opens the door to the study and management of other zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease.",0,"The geosimulation of West Nile virus propagation: a multi-agent and climate sensitive tool for risk management in public health BACKGROUND: Since 1999, the expansion of the West Nile virus (WNV) epizooty has led public health authorities to build and operate surveillance systems in North America.

"Assessing the Methods, Tools, and Statistical Approaches in Google Trends Research: Systematic Review","BACKGROUND: In the era of information overload, are big data analytics the answer to access and better manage available knowledge? Over the last decade, the use of Web-based data in public health issues, that is, infodemiology, has been proven useful in assessing various aspects of human behavior. Google Trends is the most popular tool to gather such information, and it has been used in several topics up to this point, with health and medicine being the most focused subject. Web-based behavior is monitored and analyzed in order to examine actual human behavior so as to predict, better assess, and even prevent health-related issues that constantly arise in everyday life. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed at reporting and further presenting and analyzing the methods, tools, and statistical approaches for Google Trends (infodemiology) studies in health-related topics from 2006 to 2016 to provide an overview of the usefulness of said tool and be a point of reference for future research on the subject. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for selecting studies, we searched for the term “Google Trends” in the Scopus and PubMed databases from 2006 to 2016, applying specific criteria for types of publications and topics. A total of 109 published papers were extracted, excluding duplicates and those that did not fall inside the topics of health and medicine or the selected article types. We then further categorized the published papers according to their methodological approach, namely, visualization, seasonality, correlations, forecasting, and modeling. RESULTS: All the examined papers comprised, by definition, time series analysis, and all but two included data visualization. A total of 23.1% (24/104) studies used Google Trends data for examining seasonality, while 39.4% (41/104) and 32.7% (34/104) of the studies used correlations and modeling, respectively. Only 8.7% (9/104) of the studies used Google Trends data for predictions and forecasting in health-related topics; therefore, it is evident that a gap exists in forecasting using Google Trends data. CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of online queries can provide insight into human behavior, as this field is significantly and continuously growing and will be proven more than valuable in the future for assessing behavioral changes and providing ground for research using data that could not have been accessed otherwise.",0,"Assessing the Methods, Tools, and Statistical Approaches in Google Trends Research: Systematic Review BACKGROUND: In the era of information overload, are big data analytics the answer to access and better manage available knowledge?

Traffic-driven epidemic spreading in multiplex networks,"Recent progress on multiplex networks has provided a powerful way to abstract the diverse interaction of a network system with multiple layers. In this paper, we show that a multiplex structure can greatly affect the spread of an epidemic driven by traffic dynamics. One of the interesting findings is that the multiplex structure could suppress the outbreak of an epidemic, which is different from the typical finding of spread dynamics in multiplex networks. In particular, one layer with dense connections can attract more traffic flow and eventually suppress the epidemic outbreak in other layers. Therefore, the epidemic threshold will be larger than the minimal threshold of the layers. With a mean-field approximation, we provide explicit expressions for the epidemic threshold and for the onset of suppressing epidemic spreading in multiplex networks. We also provide the probability of obtaining a multiplex configuration that suppresses the epidemic spreading when the multiplex is composed of: (i) two Erdős-Rényi layers and (ii) two scale-free layers. Therefore, compared to the situation of an isolated network in which a disease may be able to propagate, a larger epidemic threshold can be found in multiplex structures.",0,"Traffic-driven epidemic spreading in multiplex networks Recent progress on multiplex networks has provided a powerful way to abstract the diverse interaction of a network system with multiple layers.

Imaging of Pulmonary Infection,"The spectrum of organisms known to cause respiratory infections is broad and constantly increasing as new pathogens are identified, and an increasing number of patients have impaired immunity due to disease or medications.

Asthma and Microbes: A New Paradigm,"Asthma is worldwide at pandemic levels for the past 30 years but is increasing at a greater rate in more affluent societies. It is a heterogeneous disorder caused by interaction between genetic predisposition, atopy, and environmental factors, including allergens, air pollution, and respiratory infections. The pathological aspects and pathophysiological mechanisms are reviewed in this chapter. Allergens or infectious agents may stimulate Th-2 inflammation which causes activation of IL-13, eosinophils, and increase IgE levels, subsequently leading to bronchial smooth muscle hypercontraction. Respiratory viral infections are well-known causes of precipitation of acute asthma exacerbations in 50–60 % of attacks. There is also increasing evidence that bacterial infections, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, may contribute to the onset and course of asthma. The two main hypothesis of microbial genesis of asthma that has arisen in the past 20–30 years appears to be incongruous, but are not, are the hygiene hypothesis of asthma, and the virus-related asthma, early onset of viral bronchiolitis in the susceptible hosts being responsible for later development of asthma. The clinical and experimental evidences to support these contentions are reviewed and critiqued.",0,"Asthma and Microbes: A New Paradigm Asthma is worldwide at pandemic levels for the past 30 years but is increasing at a greater rate in more affluent societies.

Role of microbiota on lung homeostasis and diseases,"The lungs, as a place of gas exchange, are continuously exposed to environmental stimuli, such as allergens, microbes, and pollutants. The development of the culture-independent technique for microbiological analysis, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, has uncovered that the lungs are not sterile and, in fact, colonized by diverse communities of microbiota. The function of intestinal microbiota in modulating mucosal homeostasis and defense has been widely studied; however, the potential function of lung microbiota in regulating immunity and homeostasis has just begun. Increasing evidence indicates the relevance of microbiota to lung homeostasis and disease. In this review, we describe the distribution and composition of microbiota in the respiratory system and discuss the potential function of lung microbiota in both health and acute/chronic lung disease. In addition, we also discuss the recent understanding of the gut-lung axis, because several studies have revealed that the immunological interaction among the gut, the lung, and the microbiota was involved in this issue.",0,"Role of microbiota on lung homeostasis and diseases The lungs, as a place of gas exchange, are continuously exposed to environmental stimuli, such as allergens, microbes, and pollutants.

Anti-TGEV Miller Strain Infection Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum Supernatant Based on the JAK-STAT1 Signaling Pathway,"Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is one many gastrointestinal inflections in piglets, characterized by diarrhea, and high mortality. Probiotics are ubiquitous bacteria in animal intestines, which have many functions, such as promoting intestinal peristalsis and maintaining the intestinal balance. We found that the supernatant of the Lp-1 strain of Lactobacillus plantarum, isolated in our laboratory, and named Lp-1s had marked anti-TGEV effect on IPEC-J2 cells. Lp-1s could induce large amounts of interferon-β in IPEC-J2 cells in the early stage (6 h) of infection with TGEV, and increased the level of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription and its nuclear translocation in the late stage (24–48 h) of infection.

Low-temperature laminar flow ward for the treatment of multidrug resistance Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of low-temperature laminar flow ward (LTLFW) on the Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia (MDR-ABP) in neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU) patients. We evaluated whether patients in a LTLFW had significantly improved clinical outcomes as compared to those in nonconstant-temperature NICU (room temperature). The association of temperature with the prevalence of ABP and A. baumannii isolates (ABI) found in NICU patients was specifically investigated. In vitro microbiological experiments were conducted to measure the proliferation, antibiotic sensitivity, and genomic profiles of A. baumannii (AB) that grew in variable temperatures. MDR-ABP patients in LTLFW had significantly improved outcomes than those in the room temperature NICU. In addition, the numbers of ABI were positively associated with mean ambient outdoor temperatures (P = 0.002), with the incidence of ABP and average numbers of ABI among NICU patients being substantially lower in the winter as compared to other seasons. However, there were no significant seasonal variations in the other strains of the top five bacteria. Consistent with these clinical observations, AB growing at 20°C and 25°C had significantly reduced viability and antibiotic resistance compared to those growing at 35°C. The expression of genes related to AB survival ability, drug resistance, and virulence also differed between AB growing at 20°C and those at 35°C. LTLFW is effective in promoting the recovery of MDR-ABP patients because low temperatures reduced the density and virulence of AB and enhanced the efficacy of antibiotics, likely at the genetic level.

Comparing the outcomes of different postgraduate year training programs in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: Postgraduate year training programs play an important role in the development of a comprehensive medical education. The goal of these training programs is to inculcate in physicians the expected level of skill in patient care. After the initiation of such programs in the USA, Europe, and Japan, studies were conducted in Taiwan to investigate relevant training methods, and a training system was established in 2003. Beginning with 3-month programs, followed by 6-month programs, the programs were constantly modified and enhanced by the establishment of the 1-year training program in 2011. This year was the transition period from the 6-month programs to the 1-year programs. METHODS: We used a 50-item multiple choice question (MCQ) test and six 10-min stations for objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which was composed of four stations relating to standardized patients and two stations concerning the clinical skill evaluation, to evaluate the learning results of the trainees. The trainees were divided into four groups according to the training program. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the performance of the 6 months and 1-year groups. The p values were 0.424 in the MCQ test and 0.082 in the OSCE evaluation. CONCLUSION: A well-designed postgraduate training program should develop trainees’ competencies. The results of this study may provide useful insight for ways to improve the design of training programs. Further investigation to better understand the impact of different programs is warranted.",0,"Comparing the outcomes of different postgraduate year training programs in Taiwan BACKGROUND: Postgraduate year training programs play an important role in the development of a comprehensive medical education.

Beginning with 3-month programs, followed by 6-month programs, the programs were constantly modified and enhanced by the establishment of the 1-year training program in 2011. This year was the transition period from the 6-month programs to the 1-year programs. METHODS: We used a 50-item multiple choice question (MCQ) test and six 10-min stations for objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which was composed of four stations relating to standardized patients and two stations concerning the clinical skill evaluation, to evaluate the learning results of the trainees. The trainees were divided into four groups according to the training program. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the performance of the 6 months and 1-year groups. The p values were 0.424 in the MCQ test and 0.082 in the OSCE evaluation. CONCLUSION: A well-designed postgraduate training program should develop trainees’ competencies. The results of this study may provide useful insight for ways to improve the design of training programs.

Nucleic Acid-Based Therapeutics for Pulmonary Diseases,"Nucleic acid-based therapeutics present huge potential in the treatment of pulmonary diseases ranging from lung cancer to asthma and chronic pulmonary diseases, which are often fatal and widely prevalent. The susceptibility of nucleic acids to degradation and the complex structure of lungs retard the effective pulmonary delivery of nucleic acid drug. To overcome these barriers, different strategies have been exploited to increase the delivery efficiency using chemically synthesized nucleic acids, vector encapsulation, proper formulation, and administration route. However, several limitations regarding off-target effects and immune stimulation of nucleic acid drugs hamper their translation into the clinical practice. Therefore, their successful clinical application will ultimately rely on well-developed carriers and methods to ensure safety and efficacy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the nucleic acid application for pulmonary diseases, covering action mechanism of the nucleic acid drugs, the novel delivery systems, and the current formulation for the administration to lungs. The latest advances of nucleic acid drugs under clinical evaluation to treat pulmonary disorders will also be detailed.",0,"Nucleic Acid-Based Therapeutics for Pulmonary Diseases Nucleic acid-based therapeutics present huge potential in the treatment of pulmonary diseases ranging from lung cancer to asthma and chronic pulmonary diseases, which are often fatal and widely prevalent.

Executive Dysfunction Following Critical Illness: Exploring Risk Factors and Management Options in Geriatric Populations,"Cognitive impairment is a common occurrence that has been shown to occur in over 50 % of patients following critical illness. This impairment occurs across a range of domains including attention, memory, processing speed, and executive dysfunction. In this article, we will discuss the pathophysiology behind cognitive impairment including hypoxemia and cytokines. Secondly, we will describe the risk factors for cognitive impairment including age, length of stay, and delirium. Lastly, we will review emerging data related to the use of cognitive rehabilitation, formation of postintensive care clinics in qualifying patients, and potential neuropharmacologic therapy. While our chapter focuses on cognitive impairment generally, it places a particular emphasis on executive dysfunction, not because impairment occurs solely in this domain but because impairments of an executive nature may be uniquely debilitating.",0,"Executive Dysfunction Following Critical Illness: Exploring Risk Factors and Management Options in Geriatric Populations Cognitive impairment is a common occurrence that has been shown to occur in over 50 % of patients following critical illness.

Selenium and selenoproteins: it’s role in regulation of inflammation,"ABSTRACT: Selenium is an essential immunonutrient which holds the human’s metabolic activity with its chemical bonds. The organic forms of selenium naturally present in human body are selenocysteine and selenoproteins. These forms have a unique way of synthesis and translational coding. Selenoproteins act as antioxidant warriors for thyroid regulation, male-fertility enhancement, and anti-inflammatory actions. They also participate indirectly in the mechanism of wound healing as oxidative stress reducers. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is the major selenoprotein present in the human body, which assists in the control of excessive production of free radical at the site of inflammation. Other than GPX, other selenoproteins include selenoprotein-S that regulates the inflammatory cytokines and selenoprotein-P that serves as an inducer of homeostasis. Previously, reports were mainly focused on the cellular and molecular mechanism of wound healing with reference to various animal models and cell lines. In this review, the role of selenium and its possible routes in translational decoding of selenocysteine, synthesis of selenoproteins, systemic action of selenoproteins and their indirect assimilation in the process of wound healing are explained in detail. Some of the selenium containing compounds which can acts as cancer preventive and therapeutics are also discussed. These compounds directly or indirectly exhibit antioxidant properties which can sustain the intracellular redox status and these activities protect the healthy cells from reactive oxygen species induced oxidative damage. Although the review covers the importance of selenium/selenoproteins in wound healing process, still some unresolved mystery persists which may be resolved in near future.

Visual Interpretability in Computer-Assisted Diagnosis of Thyroid Nodules Using Ultrasound Images,"BACKGROUND: The number of studies on deep learning in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis of thyroid nodules is increasing. However, it is difficult to explain what the models actually learn in artificial intelligence-assisted medical research. Our aim is to investigate the visual interpretability of the computer-assisted diagnosis of malignant and benign thyroid nodules using ultrasound images. MATERIAL/METHODS: We designed and implemented 2 experiments to test whether our proposed model learned to interpret the ultrasound features used by ultrasound experts to diagnose thyroid nodules. First, in an anteroposterior/transverse (A/T) ratio experiment, multiple models were trained by changing the A/T ratio of the original nodules, and their classification, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were tested. Second, in a visualization experiment, class activation mapping used global average pooling and a fully connected layer to visualize the neural network to show the most important features. We also examined the importance of data preprocessing. RESULTS: The A/T ratio experiment showed that after changing the A/T ratio of the nodules, the accuracy of the neural network model was reduced by 9.24–30.45%, indicating that our neural network model learned the A/T ratio information of the nodules. The visual experiment results showed that the nodule margins had a strong influence on the prediction of the neural network. CONCLUSIONS: This study was an active exploration of interpretability in the deep learning classification of thyroid nodules. It demonstrated the neural network-visualized model focused on irregular nodule margins and the A/T ratio to classify thyroid nodules.",0,"Visual Interpretability in Computer-Assisted Diagnosis of Thyroid Nodules Using Ultrasound Images BACKGROUND: The number of studies on deep learning in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis of thyroid nodules is increasing.

Systematic Review of Ticks and Tick-Borne Pathogens of Small Ruminants in Pakistan,"Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDis) are a major constraint to the health and production of small ruminants in Pakistan. Despite being the subject of intermittent studies over the past few decades, comprehensive information on the epidemiology and control of TTBDis is lacking. Herein, we have systematically reviewed the current knowledge on TTBDis of small ruminants in Pakistan. Critical appraisal of the selected 71 articles published between 1947 to 2020 revealed that morphological examination had been the most widely used method for the identification of TTBDis in Pakistan. Tick fauna comprise at least 40 species, mainly belonging to Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus. The prevalence of ticks is the highest in summer (June–September) and it is also higher in goats than sheep. Anaplasma, Babesia and Theileria spp. are the major tick-borne pathogens (TBPs), and their prevalence is usually higher in sheep than goats. Spatio-temporal distribution, genetic diversity and control of ticks and TBPs of small ruminants as well as the competence of tick vectors for various TBPs remain to be explored. Therefore, coordinated and focused investigations are required to fill knowledge gaps in these areas to maximise the health, production and welfare of small ruminants and minimise economic losses associated with TTBDis in Pakistan.",0,"Systematic Review of Ticks and Tick-Borne Pathogens of Small Ruminants in Pakistan Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDis) are a major constraint to the health and production of small ruminants in Pakistan.

Recognition ability and cytotoxicity of some oligosaccharidylsubstituted β-cyclodextrins,"This paper reports a chemico-enzymatic synthesis of β-CD derivatives. The recognition properties of these derivativeswere tested using flocculating yeast and isolated lectins. It was observed that the substitution of β-cyclodextrins with galactose end arms induces the better recognition by a cell-linked galactose-specific lectin. The physicochemical effects of the β-CD derivatives on membranes were estimated using red blood cells and the effects on the viability of yeast and human rectal tumor cells were appreciated by measuring the mitochondrial deshydrogenase activity. The substitutions of the β-CD ring by sugar antennae decrease the negative physicochemical effects of the β-CD, ie their, hemolytic properties. However, these substitutions induce significant modifications of the biological properties of the molecules, particularly the cytotoxicity and the growth of eukaryotic cells.",0,"Recognition ability and cytotoxicity of some oligosaccharidylsubstituted β-cyclodextrins This paper reports a chemico-enzymatic synthesis of β-CD derivatives.

Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases: more questions than answers,"The structures of cellular oligosaccharides are determined by a series of processing reactions catalyzed by Golgi glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. While there are subtle cell type differences in Golgi enzyme subcompartmentation, in general, glycosylation enzymes are localized within the Golgi cisternae in the same sequence in which they act to modify oligosaccharide substrates. The possibility that this enzyme subcompartmentation may control the types of oligosaccharides expressed by a cell has led to an interest in the signals and mechanisms directing enzyme localization in the Golgi cisternae. All glycosidases and glycosyltransferases characterized thus far have very little sequence homology that might suggest a common Golgi retention signal, but they do share a similar domain structure. They are all type II transmembrane proteins consisting of an amino terminal cytoplasmic tail, a signal anchor transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large luminal catalytic domain. Their lack of sequence homology suggests that these proteins' Golgi retention signals are not linear amino acid sequences, but most likely involve general characteristics or conformations of larger protein domains. The peptide sequences required for Golgi retention of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcTI), (β1,4-galactosyltrans- ferase (GalT) and α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) have been extensively studied. To do this, researchers created mutant and chimeric proteins, expressed these in tissue culture cells, and localized these proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy. The cell surface expression of deletion mutants suggested that the deleted sequences were necessary for Golgi retention. Then, if these sequences were fused to a non-Golgi reporter protein and this chimeric or hybrid protein was retained in the Golgi, then these sequences were also sufficient for Golgi retention. Due to differences in reporter proteins used to construct these chimeric proteins, different cell types used for protein expression, different levels of protein expression, and different methods of cell surface protein detection, these experiments have led to somewhat confusing results. However, in general, it appears that the GalT relies primarily on its transmembrane domain for Golgi retention, while the GlcNAcTI and ST have requirements for their transmembrane regions, sequences flanking these regions, and luminal stem sequences. Based on these results, two potential Golgi retention mechanisms have been proposed and are now being tested. The observation that glycosyltransferase transmembrane domains are frequently sufficient for Golgi retention has led to the first of these models, the bilayer thickness model. This model proposes that the shorter transmembrane domains of Golgi proteins prevent them from entering cholesterol-rich transport vesicles destined for the plasma membrane,.and that this leads to Golgi retention. The second of these models is supported by the role of multiple protein domains in the Golgi retention of some proteins. This model, the oligomerization/kin recognition model of Golgi retention, proposes that the formation of insoluble protein homo-oligomers or very large hetero-oligomers prevents protein movement into transport vesicles destined for later compartments. Initial work suggests that the bilayer thickness mechanism may play a role in the retention of some Golgi retained proteins; however, it is not the sole retention mechanism. Other evidence suggests that an oligomerization/kin recognition mechanism may be more common, but definitive proof for its general use in Golgi protein retention is lacking. More research is required to further elucidate the sequences and particularly the mechanisms of Golgi retention. In the future, we hope to be able to explain the cell type differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation, the different sequence requirements for the Golgi retention of the same enzyme in various cell types, and whether differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation change the types of oligosaccharides made by a cell.",0,"Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases: more questions than answers The structures of cellular oligosaccharides are determined by a series of processing reactions catalyzed by Golgi glycosidases and glycosyltransferases.

A Network Medicine Approach for Drug Repurposing in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive hereditary muscular disease caused by a lack of dystrophin, leading to membrane instability, cell damage, and inflammatory response. However, gene-editing alone is not enough to restore the healthy phenotype and additional treatments are required. In the present study, we have first conducted a meta-analysis of three microarray datasets, GSE38417, GSE3307, and GSE6011, to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy donors and DMD patients. We have then integrated this analysis with the knowledge obtained from DisGeNET and DIAMOnD, a well-known algorithm for drug–gene association discoveries in the human interactome. The data obtained allowed us to identify novel possible target genes and were used to predict potential therapeutical options that could reverse the pathological condition.",0,"A Network Medicine Approach for Drug Repurposing in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive hereditary muscular disease caused by a lack of dystrophin, leading to membrane instability, cell damage, and inflammatory response.

Epidemiology of Infections in Cancer Patients,"Although major advances in the care of cancer patients over the past several decades have resulted in improved survival, infectious complications remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. To successfully identify, treat, and prevent infections, a comprehensive understanding of risk factors that predispose to infection and of commonly encountered pathogens is necessary. In addition, clinicians must keep abreast of the changing epidemiology of infections in this population.

"Mechanisms, biomarkers and targets for adult-onset Still’s disease","Adult-onset Still’s disease (AoSD) is a rare but clinically well-known, polygenic, systemic autoinflammatory disease. Owing to its sporadic appearance in all adult age groups with potentially severe inflammatory onset accompanied by a broad spectrum of disease manifestation and complications, AoSD is an unsolved challenge for clinicians with limited therapeutic options. This Review provides a comprehensive insight into the complex and heterogeneous nature of AoSD, describing biomarkers of the disease and its progression and the cytokine signalling pathways that contribute to disease. The efficacy and safety of biologic therapeutic options are also discussed, and guidance for treatment decisions is provided. Improving the approach to AoSD in the future will require much closer cooperation between paediatric and adult rheumatologists to establish common diagnostic strategies, treatment targets and goals.",0,"Mechanisms, biomarkers and targets for adult-onset Still’s disease Adult-onset Still’s disease (AoSD) is a rare but clinically well-known, polygenic, systemic autoinflammatory disease.

Recent developments in the use of transgenic plants for the production of human therapeutics and biopharmaceuticals,"In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the application of plant biotechnology for the production of a variety of commercially valuable simple and complex biological molecules (biologics) for use in human and animal healthcare. Transgenic whole plants and plant cell culture systems have been developed that have the capacity to economically produce large-scale quantities of antibodies and antibody fragments, antigens and/or vaccine epitopes, metabolic enzymes, hormones, (neuro)peptides and a variety of biologically active complexes and secondary metabolites for direct use as therapeutic agents or diagnostic tools in the medical healthcare industry. As the products of genetically modified plants make their way from concept to commercialization the associated risks and acceptance by the public has been become a focal point. In this paper, we summarize the recent advances made in the use of transgenic plants and plant cell cultures as biological factories for the production of human therapeutics and biopharmaceuticals and discuss the long-term potential of `molecular farming' as a low-cost, efficient method for the production of biological materials with demonstrated utility to the pharmaceutical industry or medical community.",0,"Recent developments in the use of transgenic plants for the production of human therapeutics and biopharmaceuticals In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the application of plant biotechnology for the production of a variety of commercially valuable simple and complex biological molecules (biologics) for use in human and animal healthcare.

Membrane vesiculation induced by proteins of the dengue virus envelope studied by molecular dynamics simulations,"Biological membranes are continuously remodeled in the cell by specific membrane-shaping machineries to form, for example, tubes and vesicles. We examine fundamental mechanisms involved in the vesiculation processes induced by a cluster of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of the dengue virus (DENV) using molecular dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained model. We show that an arrangement of three E-M heterotetramers (EM(3)) works as a bending unit and an ordered cluster of five such units generates a closed vesicle, reminiscent of the virus budding process. In silico mutagenesis of two charged residues of the anchor helices of the envelope proteins of DENV shows that Arg-471 and Arg-60 are fundamental to produce bending stress on the membrane. The fine-tuning between the size of the EM(3) unit and its specific bending action suggests this protein unit is an important factor in determining the viral particle size.",0,"Membrane vesiculation induced by proteins of the dengue virus envelope studied by molecular dynamics simulations Biological membranes are continuously remodeled in the cell by specific membrane-shaping machineries to form, for example, tubes and vesicles.

Adverse events experienced with intrahospital transfer of critically ill patients: A national survey,"Research that focuses on transfers to and from the intensive care unit (ICU) could highlight important patients’ safety issues. This study aims to describe healthcare workers’ (HCWs) practices involved in patient transfers to or from the ICU. This cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs during the Saudi Critical Care Society's annual International Conference, April 2017. Responses were assessed using Likert scales and frequencies. Bivariate analysis was used to evaluate the significance of different indicators. Overall, 312 HCWs participated in this study. Regarding transfer to ICUs, the most frequently reported complications were deterioration in respiratory status (51.4%), followed by deterioration in hemodynamic status (46.5%), and missing clinical information (35.5%). Regarding transfers from ICUs to the general ward, the most commonly reported complications were changes in respiratory status (55.6%), followed by incomplete clinical information (37.9%), and change in hemodynamic conditions (29%). The most-used models for communicating transfers were written documents in electronic health records (69.3%) and verbal communication (62.8%). One-fourth of the respondents were not aware of the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) method of patients’ handover. Pearson's test of correlation showed that the HCW's perceived satisfaction with their hospital transfer guidelines showed significant negative correlation with their reported transfer-related complications (r = −0.27, P < .010). Hemodynamic and respiratory status deterioration is representing significant adverse events among patients transferred to or from the ICU. Factors controlling the perceived satisfaction of HCWs involved in patients, transfer to and from the ICU need to be addressed, focusing on their compliance to the hospital-wide transfer and handover policies. Quality improvement initiatives could improve patient safety to transfer patients to and from the ICU and minimize the associated adverse events.",0,"Adverse events experienced with intrahospital transfer of critically ill patients: A national survey Research that focuses on transfers to and from the intensive care unit (ICU) could highlight important patients’ safety issues.

Loss of cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) induces the transsulfuration pathway and inhibits ferroptosis induced by cystine deprivation,"Ferroptosis is a form of regulated non-apoptotic cell death that has been implicated in several disease contexts. A better understanding of the ferroptotic death mechanism could lead to the development of new therapeutics for degenerative diseases, and a better understanding of how to induce ferroptosis in specific tumor contexts. We performed an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen to find genetic suppressors of ferroptosis. We determined that loss of CARS, the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, suppresses ferroptosis induced by erastin, which inhibits the cystine–glutamate antiporter known as system x(c)(−). Knockdown of CARS inhibited erastin-induced death by preventing the induction of lipid reactive oxygen species, without altering iron homeostasis. Knockdown of CARS led to the accumulation of cystathionine, a metabolite on the transsulfuration pathway, and upregulated genes associated with serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. In addition, inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway resensitized cells to erastin, even after CARS knockdown. These studies demonstrate a new mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis and may lead to strategies for inducing and suppressing ferroptosis in diverse contexts.",0,"Loss of cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) induces the transsulfuration pathway and inhibits ferroptosis induced by cystine deprivation Ferroptosis is a form of regulated non-apoptotic cell death that has been implicated in several disease contexts.

Cosmopolitanism and foreign policy for health: ethics for and beyond the state,"BACKGROUND: Foreign policy holds great potential to improve the health of a global citizenship. Our contemporary political order is, in part, characterized by sovereign states acting either in opposition or cooperation with other sovereign states. This order is also characterized by transnational efforts to address transnational issues such as those featured so prominently in the area of global health, such as the spread of infectious disease, health worker migration and the movement of health-harming products. These two features of the current order understandably create tension for truly global initiatives. DISCUSSION: National security has become the dominant ethical frame underlying the health-based foreign policy of many states, despite the transnational nature of many contemporary health challenges. This ethical approach engages global health as a means to achieving national security objectives. Implicit in this ethical frame is the version of humanity that dichotomizes between “us” and “them”. What has been left out of this discourse, for the most part, is the role that foreign policy can play in extending the responsibility of states to protect and promote health of the other, for the sake of the other. SUMMARY: The principal purpose of this paper is to review arguments for a cosmopolitan ethics of health-based foreign policy. I will argue that health-based foreign policy that is motivated by security interests is lacking both morally and practically to further global health goals. In other words, a cosmopolitan ethic is not only intrinsically superior as a moral ideal, but also has potential to contribute to utilitarian ends. This paper draws on the cosmopolitanism literature to build robust support for foreign policies that contribute to sustainable systems of global health governance.",0,"Cosmopolitanism and foreign policy for health: ethics for and beyond the state BACKGROUND: Foreign policy holds great potential to improve the health of a global citizenship.

Compounded trauma: A qualitative study of the challenges for refugees living with advanced cancer,"BACKGROUND: Although palliative care is now an essential health service under Universal Health Coverage, ensuring access and appropriate care for refugees is a specific challenge for this large population. AIM: To identify the needs and experiences of adult refugees in Jordan with advanced cancer and informal caregivers. DESIGN: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were purposively sampled at two Jordanian hospitals to achieve heterogeneity by age, gender, country of origin, and primary diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine refugees (22 patients, 7 caregivers) participated, and four themes were generated: (1) Psychological distress and sustaining social support. Refugees often experienced unmet psychosocial needs. However, psychosocial support was reported either absent or limited. (2) Knowledge and uncertainty. Lack of information and poor communication between healthcare providers and patients caused significant distress due to uncertainty. (3) Family anxiety and support roles. Being away from the home country cut patients and caregivers off from their wider social support network, which added increased anxiety and responsibilities to caregivers. (4) Compounded trauma and poverty. Many refugees have experienced trauma related to war that may affect their physical and mental health. They faced serious financial crises caused by the rising cost of medicines and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the impact of fractured families and networks on social support in advanced cancer, and the compounding trauma of the disease for refugees. Detailed person-centred assessment and emphasis on psychosocial support is essential, and home-based care should not presume community support for patients to remain at home.",0,"Compounded trauma: A qualitative study of the challenges for refugees living with advanced cancer BACKGROUND: Although palliative care is now an essential health service under Universal Health Coverage, ensuring access and appropriate care for refugees is a specific challenge for this large population.

This study aimed to identify the gaps of knowledge among Jordanian population towards influenza and its vaccine, and to identify the major determinants of accepting seasonal influenza vaccine in adults and children in Jordan. METHODS. This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 941 randomly selected adults in Amman, Jordan. A four-section questionnaire was used which included questions about the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge about influenza and the factors that affect seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance and refusal. RESULTS. Only 47.3% of the participants were considered knowledgeable. About half of the participants (51.9%) correctly identified the main influenza preventative measures. Lack of knowledge about the important role of seasonal influenza vaccine in disease prevention was observed. Low vaccination rate (20% of adults) was reported. The most critical barrier against vaccination in adults and children was the concern about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine, while the most important predictors for future vaccination in adults and children were physician recommendation and government role. In children, the inclusion of the vaccine within the national immunization program was an important determinant of vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION. Formulating new strategies to improve the population’s level of knowledge, assuring the population about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine and the inclusion of the vaccine within the national immunization program are the essential factors to enhance vaccination coverage in Jordan.",0,"Knowledge, awareness and practices towards seasonal influenza and its vaccine: implications for future vaccination campaigns in Jordan BACKGROUND.

The Care of Our Hybrid Selves: Ethics in Times of Technical Mediation,"What can the art of living after Foucault contribute to ethics in relation to the mediation of human existence by technology? To develop the relation between technical mediation and ethics, firstly the theme of technical mediation is elaborated in line with Foucault’s notion of ethical problematization. Every view of what technology does to us at the same time expresses an ethical concern about technology. The contemporary conception of technical mediation tends towards the acknowledgement of ongoing hybridization, not ultimately good or bad but ambivalent, which means for us the challenge of taking care of ourselves as hybrid beings. Secondly, the work of Foucault provides elements for imagining this care for our hybrid selves, notably his notions of freedom as a practice and of the care of the self. A conclusions about technical mediation and ethics is that whereas the approaches of the delegation of morality to technology by Latour and mediated morality by Verbeek see technical mediation of behavior and moral outlook as an answer in ethics, this should rather be considered the problem that ethics is about.",0,"The Care of Our Hybrid Selves: Ethics in Times of Technical Mediation What can the art of living after Foucault contribute to ethics in relation to the mediation of human existence by technology?

The Domain-Specific and Temperature-Dependent Protein Misfolding Phenotype of Variant Medium-Chain acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase,"The implementation of expanded newborn screening programs reduced mortality and morbidity in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) caused by mutations in the ACADM gene. However, the disease is still potentially fatal. Missense induced MCADD is a protein misfolding disease with a molecular loss-of-function phenotype. Here we established a comprehensive experimental setup to analyze the structural consequences of eight ACADM missense mutations (p.Ala52Val, p.Tyr67His, p.Tyr158His, p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly, p.Lys329Glu, p.Arg334Lys, p.Arg413Ser) identified after newborn screening and linked the corresponding protein misfolding phenotype to the site of side-chain replacement with respect to the domain. With fever being the crucial risk factor for metabolic decompensation of patients with MCADD, special emphasis was put on the analysis of structural and functional derangements related to thermal stress. Based on protein conformation, thermal stability and kinetic stability, the molecular phenotype in MCADD depends on the structural region that is affected by missense-induced conformational changes with the central β-domain being particularly prone to structural derangement and destabilization. Since systematic classification of conformational derangements induced by ACADM mutations may be a helpful tool in assessing the clinical risk of patients, we scored the misfolding phenotype of the variants in comparison to p.Lys329Glu (K304E), the classical severe mutation, and p.Tyr67His (Y42H), discussed to be mild. Experiments assessing the impact of thermal stress revealed that mutations in the ACADM gene lower the temperature threshold at which MCAD loss-of-function occurs. Consequently, increased temperature as it occurs during intercurrent infections, significantly increases the risk of further conformational derangement and loss of function of the MCAD enzyme explaining the life-threatening clinical courses observed during fever episodes. Early and aggressive antipyretic treatment thus may be life-saving in patients suffering from MCADD.",0,"The Domain-Specific and Temperature-Dependent Protein Misfolding Phenotype of Variant Medium-Chain acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase The implementation of expanded newborn screening programs reduced mortality and morbidity in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) caused by mutations in the ACADM gene.

Drivers of Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases,"This chapter discusses drivers of emerging infectious diseases (EID) of humans that have an origin in other vertebrate animals (zoonoses). This is a broad topic, worthy of a book in its own right. This chapter will therefore provide only an overview of key concepts of drivers of the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and particularly infectious diseases with a major disease burden in humans. As the authors mainly work in Asia, the focus of this chapter is Asia, but many of the lessons learned in this region are likely to apply elsewhere. More than 60 % of the world population live in Asia, a region with some of the fastest developing economies in the world. Yet, despite tremendous advances, infectious diseases still remain a major burden for the human population in Asia. Of the estimated 2.1 million deaths in children aged less than 5 years in Southeast Asia in 2010, 47 % are attributable to infectious causes (Liu et al., Lancet 379:2151–2161, 2012). As such, Asia is both vulnerable to imported EIDs and a global focus of major social and environmental change that may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of new pathogens. However, it would be too simplistic to present the extensive changes in Asia as inevitably increasing the risk of EIDs. Some aspects of socio-economic change might serve to reduce the overall risk of infectious disease emergence, but all ecosystem changes have the potential to provide new opportunities for microorganisms to spill-over into human populations.",0,"Drivers of Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases This chapter discusses drivers of emerging infectious diseases (EID) of humans that have an origin in other vertebrate animals (zoonoses).

RNA pseudoknots downstream of the frameshift sites of retroviruses,"RNA pseudoknot structural motifs could have implications for a wide range of biological processes of RNAs. In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frameshift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pool or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of propol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. [1] and Jacks et al.

Hemostatic Resuscitation,"Advances in surgical and critical care medicine frequently parallel the course of armed conflict. Indeed, surgery is a specialty born of warfare and will continue to drive advancements as mankind finds new and more lethal methods of combat. As hemorrhage is far and away the leading cause of potentially survivable death on the battlefield, the methods of resuscitation and blood transfusion continue to evolve. The critical role that blood plays in resuscitation of the critically injured patient was first explored during World War I for the treatment of ‘wound shock’. Type O whole blood was collected in sterile glass bottles containing citrate and transfused into patients prior to surgery. During the years following World War I, blood component fractionation became available, blood banking was initiated, and the transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets became a mainstay of the trauma management paradigm. However, in times of war the variable availability of short-lived platelets, FFP, and cryoprecipitate inevitably leads back to the resurrection of fresh whole blood transfusion. Fresh whole blood, though not without some risk, restores the hemostatic mechanism and provides volume and oxygen-carrying capacity.",0,"Hemostatic Resuscitation Advances in surgical and critical care medicine frequently parallel the course of armed conflict.

Beyond Type 1 Regulatory T Cells: Co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b in IL-10-Producing T Cell Lineages,"Type 1 regulatory CD4(+) T (Tr1) cells express high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 but not the master transcription factor Foxp3, and can suppress inflammation and promote immune tolerance. In order to identify and obtain viable Tr1 cells for research and clinical applications, co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 has been proposed as a unique surface signature for both human and mouse Tr1 cells. However, recent studies have revealed that this pattern of co-expression is dependent on the stimulating conditions and the differentiation stage of the CD4(+) T cells. Here, using an IL-10(GFP)/Foxp3(RFP) dual reporter transgenic murine model, we demonstrate that co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 is not restricted to the Foxp3(−) Tr1 cells, but is also observed in Foxp3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells and CD8(+) T cells that produce IL-10. Our data indicate that IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, Treg cells and CD8(+) T cells are all capable of co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b in vitro following differentiation under IL-10-inducing conditions, and in vivo following pathogenic insult or infection in the pulmonary mucosa. Our findings urge caution in the use of LAG3/CD49b co-expression as sole markers to identify Tr1 cells, since it may mark IL-10-producing T cell lineages more broadly, including the Foxp3(−) Tr1 cells, Foxp3(+) Treg cells, and CD8(+) T cells.",0,"Beyond Type 1 Regulatory T Cells: Co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b in IL-10-Producing T Cell Lineages Type 1 regulatory CD4(+) T (Tr1) cells express high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 but not the master transcription factor Foxp3, and can suppress inflammation and promote immune tolerance.

The application of hybridoma technology to the study of bovine immunoglobulins,"Studies are described in which hybridoma technology is used to produce a variety of reagents for the characterization and manipulation of the bovine humoral immune system. Selected members of a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for each of four major isotypes of bovine Ig constant regions, one specific for anti-bovine Ig constant regions as well as one specific for anti-bovine light chains are discussed. Interspecific fusion of bovine lymphocytes with the established mouse cell line, SP2/0 was used to produce a collection of stable hybridomas among which were found secretors of bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and bovine light chain. Interspecific fusion of SP2/0 with lymphocytes from a multiparous Holstein four days post immunization with Streptococcus agalactiae yielded MAb with specificity for the immunizing antigen.

"CEACAM1 in Liver Injury, Metabolic and Immune Regulation","Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on epithelial, endothelial and immune cells. CEACAM1 is a differentiation antigen involved in the maintenance of epithelial polarity that is induced during hepatocyte differentiation and liver regeneration. CEACAM1 regulates insulin sensitivity by promoting hepatic insulin clearance, and controls liver tolerance and mucosal immunity. Obese insulin-resistant humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease manifest loss of hepatic CEACAM1. In mice, deletion or functional inactivation of CEACAM1 impairs insulin clearance and compromises metabolic homeostasis which initiates the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis with other features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and adipogenesis in white adipose depot. This is followed by inflammation and endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunctions. In obstructive and inflammatory liver diseases, soluble CEACAM1 is shed into human bile where it can serve as an indicator of liver disease. On immune cells, CEACAM1 acts as an immune checkpoint regulator, and deletion of Ceacam1 gene in mice causes exacerbation of inflammation and hyperactivation of myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Hence, hepatic CEACAM1 resides at the central hub of immune and metabolic homeostasis in both humans and mice. This review focuses on the regulatory role of CEACAM1 in liver and biliary tract architecture in health and disease, and on its metabolic role and function as an immune checkpoint regulator of hepatic inflammation.",0,"CEACAM1 in Liver Injury, Metabolic and Immune Regulation Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on epithelial, endothelial and immune cells.

Optimizing classical risk scores to predict complications in head and neck surgery: a new approach,"PURPOSE: To validate tools to identify patients at risk for perioperative complications to implement prehabilitation programmes in head and neck surgery (H&N). METHODS: Retrospective cohort including 128 patients submitted to H&N, with postoperative Intermediate Care Unit admittance. The accuracy of the risk calculators ASA, P-POSSUM, ACS-NSQIP and ARISCAT to predict postoperative complications and mortality was assessed. A multivariable analysis was subsequently performed to create a new risk prediction model for serious postoperative complications in our institution. RESULTS: Our 30-day morbidity and mortality were 45.3% and 0.8%, respectively. The ACS-NSQIP failed to predict complications and had an acceptable discrimination ability for predicting death. The discrimination ability of ARISCAT for predicting respiratory complications was acceptable. ASA and P-POSSUM were poor predictors for mortality and morbidity. Our new prediction model included ACS-NSQIP and ARISCAT (area under the curve 0.750, 95% confidence intervals: 0.63–0.87). CONCLUSION: Despite the insufficient value of these risk calculators when analysed individually, we designed a risk tool combining them which better predicts the risk of serious complications.

Endogenous Retrovirus ev21 Dose Not Recombine with ALV-J and Induces the Expression of ISGs in the Host,"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression. Endogenous viruses integrate into host genomes and can recombine with exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV). In this study, we analyzed the interaction of endogenous retrovirus 21 (ev21) with the ALV-J in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken. Two ALV-J strains M180 and K243 were isolated from late-feathering and fast-feathering Chinese yellow chicken flocks, respectively. The env gene of the two strains showed 94.2–94.8% nucleotide identity with reference ALV-J strains. Compared with the env gene and the LTR of ev21 and M180, the nucleotide identity of LTR was 69.7% and env gene was 58.4%, respectively, especially the amino acid identity of env gene as low as 14.2%. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the env gene and the 3′LTR showed that M180 was closely related to ALV-J, and was located in a distinct group with ev21 in the phylogenetic tree. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), we next demonstrate that the envelope protein of ev21 does not interact with the M180 envelope protein. We further show that the envelope protein of ev21 cannot activate ALV-J LTR promoter activity using luciferase-reporter assays. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that envelope protein of endogenous ev21 can facilitate the expression of PKR at 6h post ALV-J infection (hpi) and facilitate the expression of ISG12 and CH25H at 24 hpi. However, the expression of the env gene of M180 strain was not significantly at 6 and 24 hpi. We conclude that there is no evidence of recombination between endogenous retrovirus ev21 and ALV-J strain M180 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken, and envelope protein of ev21 can affect the expression of host ISGs, but appears not to influence the replication of ALV-J strain M180.

Chaos in a seasonally perturbed SIR model: avian influenza in a seabird colony as a paradigm,"Seasonality is a complex force in nature that affects multiple processes in wild animal populations. In particular, seasonal variations in demographic processes may considerably affect the persistence of a pathogen in these populations. Furthermore, it has been long observed in computer simulations that under seasonal perturbations, a host–pathogen system can exhibit complex dynamics, including the transition to chaos, as the magnitude of the seasonal perturbation increases. In this paper, we develop a seasonally perturbed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model of avian influenza in a seabird colony. Numerical simulations of the model give rise to chaotic recurrent epidemics for parameters that reflect the ecology of avian influenza in a seabird population, thereby providing a case study for chaos in a host– pathogen system. We give a computer-assisted exposition of the existence of chaos in the model using methods that are based on the concept of topological hyperbolicity. Our approach elucidates the geometry of the chaos in the phase space of the model, thereby offering a mechanism for the persistence of the infection. Finally, the methods described in this paper may be immediately extended to other infections and hosts, including humans.",0,"Chaos in a seasonally perturbed SIR model: avian influenza in a seabird colony as a paradigm Seasonality is a complex force in nature that affects multiple processes in wild animal populations.

The role of the angiotensin II type I receptor blocker telmisartan in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a brief review,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently considered an important component of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The spectrum of NAFLD includes conditions that range from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. NAFLD is correlated with liver-related death and is predicted to be the most frequent indication for liver transplantation by 2030. Insulin resistance is directly correlated to the central mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients, which is strongly correlated to the imbalance of the renin–angiotensin system, that is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Among the emerging treatment approaches for NAFLD is the anti-hypertensive agent telmisartan, which has positive effects on liver, lipid, and glucose metabolism, especially through its action on the renin–angiotensin system, by blocking the ACE/AngII/AT1 axis and increasing ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas axis activation. However, treatment with this drug is only recommended for patients with an established indication for anti-hypertensive therapy. Thus, there is an increased need for large randomized controlled trials with the aim of elucidating the effects of telmisartan on liver disease, especially NAFLD. From this perspective, the present review aims to provide a brief examination of the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH and the role of telmisartan on preventing liver disorders and thus to improve the discussion on potential therapies.",0,"The role of the angiotensin II type I receptor blocker telmisartan in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a brief review Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently considered an important component of metabolic syndrome (MetS).

Infections with Legionella pneumophila in Children,"To learn the role of Legionella pneumophila, the agent of Legionnaires' disease, in childhood illness, a prospective study was conducted among 52 children younger than four years of age with acute disease of the lower respiratory tract. Viral, mycoplasmal, and bacterial cultures and acute- and convalescent-phase sera were obtained during 64 episodes of acute illness; additional sera were drawn annually for three to five years. On the basis of serologic evidence, none of the acute episodes appeared to be due to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 or 2. However, examination of annual serum specimens showed that 27 (52%) of the children had rises in titer of indirect immunofluorescent antibody (a fourfold or greater rise to a reciprocal titer of ⩾128). Most rises in titer were in response to the serogroup 2 antigen. These results suggest that L. pneumophila is not a common cause of acute respiratory disease in early childhood in the study area but that children are frequently exposed to the organism. Alternatively, the serologic responses might be to unrelated cross-reacting microorganisms.",0,"Infections with Legionella pneumophila in Children To learn the role of Legionella pneumophila, the agent of Legionnaires' disease, in childhood illness, a prospective study was conducted among 52 children younger than four years of age with acute disease of the lower respiratory tract.

"News Journalists and Postruamatic Stress Disorder: a Review of Literature, 2011–2020","Research has demonstrated that first responders may develop psychological trauma/ posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the performance of their duties. Often overlooked in these studies of police, firefighters, and paramedics is an additional group of providers who also respond to these same events: news journalists and photo journalists. Although limited in scope, the research literature from 1980 to 2010 assessed an association between PTSD and some news journalists. The strength of these findings are limited due to serious methodological limitations. The present paper reviewed the journalist/PTSD literature from 2011 to 2020. There were 4558 subjects in 23 studies, which were world-wide in scope. There were 2633 male reporters (58%) and 1925 female journalists (42%). The average age of subjects was 34.37 years and the average length of experience was 10.68 years. Many reported either PTSD, PTSD symptoms, depression, and/or substance use.

The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the hospital-acquired influenza infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The hospital-acquired influenza (HAI) were usually contributed to severe outcomes among the inpatients. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize and quantify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HAI. METHODS: We performed a literature search thorough PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases for observational studies. Random/fix-effects models were used to obtain pooled proportion, odds ratio (OR), and weighted mean difference (WMD). RESULTS: A total of 14 studies involving 1483 HAI and 71849 non-hospital-acquired influenza infections (NHAI) cases were included.The proportion of the HAI among the influenza cases was 11.38% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.19%–19.55%) and it was increased after 2012 (6.15% vs 12.72%). The HAI cases were significantly older (WMD = 9.51, 95% CI: 0.04–18.98) and the patients with chronic medical diseases were at increased risk of HAI (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.57–2.19). Among them, metabolic disorders (OR = 8.10, 95% CI: 2.46–26.64) ranked the highest danger, followed by malignancy (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.12–4.76), any chronic diseases (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.08–9.31), immunosuppression (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.25–3.64), renal diseases (OR = 1.72, 95% CI:1.40–2.10), heart diseases (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03–1.44), and diabetes (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.44). The HAI cases were more likely to experience longer hospital stay (WMD = 10.23, 95% CI: 4.60–15.85) and longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay (WMD = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.50–4.48).

Effects of quasiperiodic forcing in epidemic models,"We study changes in the bifurcations of seasonally driven compartmental epidemic models, where the transmission rate is modulated temporally. In the presence of periodic modulation of the transmission rate, the dynamics varies from periodic to chaotic. The route to chaos is typically through period doubling bifurcation. There are coexisting attractors for some sets of parameters. However in the presence of quasiperiodic modulation, tori are created in place of periodic orbits and chaos appears via finite torus doublings. Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are created at the boundary of chaotic and torus dynamics. Multistability is found to be reduced as a function of quasiperiodic modulation strength. It is argued that occurrence of SNAs gives an opportunity of asymptotic predictability of epidemic growth even when the underlying dynamics is strange.",0,"Effects of quasiperiodic forcing in epidemic models We study changes in the bifurcations of seasonally driven compartmental epidemic models, where the transmission rate is modulated temporally.

Intestinal Microorganisms Do Not Supply Associated Gnotobiotic Rats with Conjugated Linoleic Acid,"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is produced from linoleic acid (LA) by bacteria in the rumen of herbivores. CLA enters the human diet mainly via milk fat and fatty beef; it acts as an effective anticarcinogen and exhibits other important physiological effects. The objective of the current study was to investigate the capability of a LA-conjugating bacterial community isolated from a human volunteer and associated with germ-free rats to supply the host with CLA. Gnotobiotic rats were fed a diet enriched with esterified LA in the form of sunflower-seed oil. The control group was fed the same diet and remained germ-free. Bacterial cell counts, in vitro LA-conjugation activities, and CLA concentration in feces and in the contents of various intestinal segments were determined. After 10 wk, various tissues were analyzed for CLA concentrations. LA-conjugation activity was found only in feces, cecum and colon content samples from associated rats, but CLA accumulation in various body tissues did not differ significantly between the two groups. The ratio of CLA to LA in feces and in cecal and colonic contents did not differ between groups, indicating that the microorganisms in the cecum and the colon do not synthesize substantial amounts of CLA in vivo and therefore, do not contribute to the CLA supplementation of the host.",0,"Intestinal Microorganisms Do Not Supply Associated Gnotobiotic Rats with Conjugated Linoleic Acid Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is produced from linoleic acid (LA) by bacteria in the rumen of herbivores.

Monoclonal antibodies against bovine immunoglobulins and their use in isotype-specific ELISAs for rotavirus antibody,"Monoclonal antibodies (MCA) against bovine immunoglobulin (BIg) isotypes were produced and characterized. MCAs were obtained which react specifically with IgG, IgG(1), IgG(2) or IgA while MCAs against IgM showed a partial cross-reaction with affinity purified IgA. MCAs with optimal characteristics for application in ELISA were selected and used as conjugates in an indirect double antibody sandwich assay (IDAS) and as the capturing antibody in an antibody capture assay (ACA) for the isotype-specific detection of antibodies against rotavirus. Based on theoretical grounds, experimental analysis of inter- and intra-isotype competition in IDAS and ACA, respectively, and direct comparison of both tests, the IDAS was selected for the detection of IgG(1) and IgG(2) anti-rotavirus antibodies. The ACA was the test of choice for the detection of IgM and IgA anti-rotavirus antibodies. The isotype specificity of these tests relies on the specificity of the MCAs and was confirmed for each test by the observation that samples containing rotavirus antibodies of only 1 particular isotypee reacted only in the homologous assay. The MCAs against bovine Ig isotypes and isotype-specific ELISAs were found to be very useful in the study of humoral mucosal immunity in calves infected with rotavirus.",0,"Monoclonal antibodies against bovine immunoglobulins and their use in isotype-specific ELISAs for rotavirus antibody Monoclonal antibodies (MCA) against bovine immunoglobulin (BIg) isotypes were produced and characterized.

Molecular basis of V-ATPase inhibition by bafilomycin A1,"Pharmacological inhibition of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) by its specific inhibitor can abrogate tumor metastasis, prevent autophagy, and reduce cellular signaling responses. Bafilomycin A1, a member of macrolide antibiotics and an autophagy inhibitor, serves as a specific and potent V-ATPases inhibitor. Although there are many V-ATPase structures reported, the molecular basis of specific inhibitors on V-ATPase remains unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of bafilomycin A1 bound intact bovine V-ATPase at an overall resolution of 3.6-Å. The structure reveals six bafilomycin A1 molecules bound to the c-ring. One bafilomycin A1 molecule engages with two c subunits and disrupts the interactions between the c-ring and subunit a, thereby preventing proton translocation. Structural and sequence analyses demonstrate that the bafilomycin A1-binding residues are conserved in yeast and mammalian species and the 7’-hydroxyl group of bafilomycin A1 acts as a unique feature recognized by subunit c.",0,"Molecular basis of V-ATPase inhibition by bafilomycin A1 Pharmacological inhibition of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) by its specific inhibitor can abrogate tumor metastasis, prevent autophagy, and reduce cellular signaling responses.

Effect of fexofenadine hydrochloride on allergic rhinitis aggravated by air pollutants,"In recent decades, seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) prevalence has increased and recent studies have shown that air pollutants, such as diesel exhaust particles (DEP), can increase inflammatory and allergic biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DEP on SAR symptoms induced by ragweed and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fexofenadine HCl 180 mg versus placebo. This phase 3, single-centre, sequential, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised study (NCT03664882) was conducted in an environmental exposure unit (EEU) during sequential exposures: Period 1 (ragweed pollen alone), Period 2 (ragweed pollen+DEP), and Period 3 (ragweed pollen+DEP+single-dose fexofenadine HCl 180 mg or placebo). Efficacy and safety were evaluated in Period 3. Primary endpoints were the area under the curve (AUC) of total nasal symptom score (TNSS) from baseline to hour 12 (AUC(0–12)) during Period 1 and Period 2; and the AUC of the TNSS from hour 2 to 12 (AUC(2–12)) during Period 3. 251 out of 257 evaluable subjects were included in the modified intent-to-treat population.

Informed Consent in the (Mis) Information Age,"Recent studies suggest that large numbers of healthcare consumers are turning to the Internet as a source of health information. This article considers the potential impact of on-line health information on women’s health-care decisions, and the role of physicians relating to their patients’ use of the Internet as an information source. In particular, the article examines the effect of on-line health information on the informed consent process. Physicians’ disclosure obligations (their legal duty to provide information to patients) and the law of informed consent are briefly described. The article then considers the Internet as a source of health information, and instances and types of misinformation. Finally, the article suggests steps physicians may take to help their patients benefit from Internet health information and to become critical consumers who do not fall victim to inaccurate or misleading information. The article concludes by suggesting that physicians make a practice of asking their patients about alternate sources of information they may have accessed, in order to help ensure that patients’ health-care decisions are based on current accurate and complete information.",0,"Informed Consent in the (Mis) Information Age Recent studies suggest that large numbers of healthcare consumers are turning to the Internet as a source of health information.

Oral healthcare workforce planning in post-Brexit Britain,"The terms of the United Kingdom's (UK's) departure from the European Union (EU) are currently being negotiated.

Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS): A Trust-Based Network,"The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) network was formally established in 2001 through a Memorandum of Understanding signed by six Ministers of Health of the countries in the Greater Mekong sub-region: Cambodia, China (Yunnan and Guangxi), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The main areas of focus of the network are to: i) improve cross-border infectious disease outbreak investigation and response by sharing surveillance data and best practices in disease recognition and reporting, and by jointly responding to outbreaks; ii) develop expertise in epidemiological surveillance across the countries; and iii) enhance communication between the countries. Comprised of senior health officials, epidemiologists, health practitioners, and other professionals, the MBDS has grown and matured over the years into an entity based on mutual trust that can be sustained into the future. Other regions have started emulating the network's pioneering work. In this paper, we describe the development of MBDS, the way in which it operates today, and some of its achievements. We present key challenges the network has faced and lessons its members have learned about how to develop sufficient trust for health and other professionals to alert each other to disease threats across national borders and thereby more effectively combat these threats.",0,"Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS): A Trust-Based Network The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) network was formally established in 2001 through a Memorandum of Understanding signed by six Ministers of Health of the countries in the Greater Mekong sub-region: Cambodia, China (Yunnan and Guangxi), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.

Comparative genomics of Streptococcus parauberis: new target for molecular identification of serotype III,"ABSTRACT: This paper describes the predicted structure for the cps loci involved in capsule biosynthesis for Streptococcus parauberis serotypes III, IV, and V. Based on the specific serotype regions I, II, and III, a multiplex PCR protocol (mPCR) was designed to differentiate the main serotypes causing fish diseases. A real-time PCR method (qPCR) is also described to identify S. parauberis of serotype III in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed that both methods have a 100% specificity. The mPCR assay was optimized for the detection of S. parauberis strains of subtypes Ia (amplicon size 213 bp), subtypes Ib and Ic (both amplicon size 303 bp), serotype II (amplicon size 403 bp), and serotype III (amplicon size 130 bp) from bacterial cultures. The qPCR assay was optimized for the identification and quantification of S. parauberis serotype III strains in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. This assay achieved a sensitivity of 2.67 × 10(2) gene copies (equivalent to 3.8 × 10(−9) ng/μl) using pure bacterial cultures of S. parauberis serotype III and 1.76 × 10(2) gene copies in fish tissues experimentally and naturally infected with S. parauberis of the serotype III. The specificity and sensitivity of the protocols described in this study suggest that these methods could be used for diagnostic and/or epidemiological purposes in clinical diagnostic laboratories.

Implementation of human factors engineering approach to improve environmental cleaning and disinfection in a medical center,"BACKGROUND: Inadequate hospital cleaning may contribute to cross-transmission of pathogens. It is important to implement effective cleaning for the safe hospital environment. We conducted a three-phase study using human factors engineering (HFE) approach to enhance environmental cleanliness. METHODS: This study was conducted using a prospective interventional trial, and 28 (33.3%) of 84 wards in a medical center were sampled. The three-phases included pre-intervention analysis (Phase 1), implementing interventions by HFE principles (Phase 2), and programmatic analysis (Phase 3). The evaluations of terminal cleaning and disinfection were performed using the fluorescent marker, the adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay, and the aerobic colony count method simultaneously in all phases. Effective terminal cleaning and disinfection was qualified with the aggregate outcome of the same 10 high-touch surfaces per room. A score for each high-touch surface was recorded, with 0 denoting a fail and 10 denoting a pass by the benchmark of the evaluation method, and the total terminal cleaning and disinfection score (TCD score) was a score out of 100. RESULTS: In each phase, 840 high-touch surfaces were collected from 84 rooms after terminal cleaning and disinfection. After the interventions, the TCD score by the three evaluation methods all showed significant improved. The carriage incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) decreased significantly from 4.1 per 1000 patient-days to 3.6 per 1000 patient-days (P = .03). CONCLUSION: The HFE approach can improve the thoroughness and the effectiveness of terminal cleaning and disinfection, and resulted in a reduction of patient carriage of MDRO at hospitals. Larger studies are necessary to establish whether such efforts of cleanliness can reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infection.",0,"Implementation of human factors engineering approach to improve environmental cleaning and disinfection in a medical center BACKGROUND: Inadequate hospital cleaning may contribute to cross-transmission of pathogens.

Epidemiological analysis of the Kaohsiung city strategy for dengue fever quarantine and epidemic prevention,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries and is an important public health problem worldwide. Dengue fever is not endemic in Taiwan; the importation of dengue viruses from neighboring countries via close commercial links and air travel is considered to be the cause of local outbreaks. Therefore, efforts toward disease control have focused on preventing the importation of dengue into Taiwan. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the numbers of imported and indigenous dengue cases to test the validity of this strategy. METHODS: Data on cases of dengue fever that occurred between 2013 and 2018 were obtained from the surveillance systems of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Kaohsiung City Health Department. Standard epidemiological data, including the monthly numbers of indigenous and imported cases of dengue, were calculated. Potential associations between the numbers of indigenous and imported cases were investigated using correlation analyses. RESULTS: We identified a possible relationship between the period of disease concealment and the number of imported dengue cases, which resulted in epidemics of indigenous dengue fever within local communities. Further analysis of confirmed cases during previous epidemics in Kaohsiung City found that the risk of indigenous dengue fever may be related to the likelihood that patients with imported dengue fever will stay within local communities. CONCLUSION: Given the correlations found between imported and indigenous cases of dengue fever, as well as the relationship between the disease concealment period and the risk of indigenous dengue fever, prevention of disease importation and efficient identification of dengue cases within high-risk communities remain the major priorities for disease control.",0,"Epidemiological analysis of the Kaohsiung city strategy for dengue fever quarantine and epidemic prevention BACKGROUND: Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries and is an important public health problem worldwide.

DNA-aided identification of Culex mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) reveals unexpected diversity in underground cavities in Austria,"Subterranean cavities serve as resting places and hibernation shelters for mosquitoes. In Europe, members of the genus Culex are often the most abundant insects on cave walls. Culex pipiens L., the common house mosquito, exists in two physically very similar, yet genetically and ecologically distinct biotypes (or forms, ‘f.’), namely Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. pipiens f. molestus. Autogeny and stenogamy of the latter form have been interpreted as adaptations to underground habitats. The epigean occurrence of the two biotypes and their hybrids was recently examined in Eastern Austria, but the hypogean distribution of the Cx. pipiens complex and morphologically similar non-members such as Cx. torrentium is unknown. Considering the key role of Culex mosquitoes in the epidemiology of certain zoonotic pathogens, the general paucity of data on species composition and relative abundance in subterranean shelters appears unfortunate. For a first pertinent investigation in Austria, we collected mosquitoes in four eastern federal states. Based on analyses of the ACE2 gene and the CQ11 microsatellite locus, 150 female and three male mosquitoes of the genus Culex, two females of the genus Culiseta and a single female of the genus Anopheles were determined to species level or below. In our catches, Cx. pipiens f. pipiens exceeded the apparent abundance of the purportedly cave-adapted Cx. pipiens f. molestus many times over. Records of Cx. hortensis and Cx. territans, two species rarely collected in Austria, lead us to infer that underground habitats host a higher diversity of culicine mosquitoes than previously thought.",0,"DNA-aided identification of Culex mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) reveals unexpected diversity in underground cavities in Austria Subterranean cavities serve as resting places and hibernation shelters for mosquitoes.

"The Role of Demoralization and Meaning in Life (DEMIL) in Influencing Suicidal Ideation Among Patients Affected by Chronic Pain: Protocol of a Single-Center, Observational, Case-Control Study","BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behavior (SB), including a 20%-40% prevalence rate of SI, a prevalence between 5% and 14% of suicide attempts, and a doubled risk of death by suicide in patients with chronic pain compared to controls. In most studies, associations between chronic pain and suicidality are robust, even after adjusting for the effect of sociodemographics and psychiatric comorbidity, and particularly for depressive conditions. A number of specific conditions that can modulate suicidality risk in patients with chronic pain have been investigated, but there is a need for their more specific characterization. Numerous recent studies have shown that demoralization and meaning in life (MiL) constructs affect suicidality as risk and protective factors, respectively. These constructs have been mainly investigated in patients with somatic illness and in community-dwelling individuals who may present with SI or SB independently of a psychiatric diagnosis of depression. However, a paucity of studies investigated them in suicidal patients affected by chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between demoralization and MiL on SI risk in patients with chronic pain. The secondary objectives are (1) to test whether demoralization can occur independently of depression in patients with chronic pain and SI, (2) to examine whether the expected association between demoralization and SI may be explained by a sole dimension of demoralization: hopelessness, (3) to examine whether the presence of MiL, but not the search for MiL, is associated with less SI, and (4) to explore whether previously described MiL profiles (ie, high presence-high search, high presence-low search, moderate presence-moderate search, low presence-low search, and low presence-high search) emerge in our cohort. METHODS: This project is a single-center, observational, case-control study—the Demoralization and Meaning in Life (DEMiL) study—conducted by the Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, and the Service of Liaison Psychiatry and Crisis Intervention at the Geneva University Hospitals. Self- and hetero-administered questionnaires were conducted among patients and controls, matched by age and gender. The Ethics Committee of the Canton of Geneva approved the scientific utilization of collected data (project No. 2017-02138; decision dated January 25, 2018). Data have been analyzed with SPSS, version 23.0, software (IBM Corp). RESULTS: From March 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019, 70 patients and 70 controls were enrolled. Statistical analyses are still in progress and are expected to be finalized in November 2020. To date, we did not observe any unfavorable event for which a causal relationship with the collection of health-related personal data could be ruled out. Results of this study are expected to form the basis for possible prevention and psychotherapeutic interventions oriented toward demoralization and MiL constructs for suicidal patients with chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: The interest in exploring demoralization and MiL in chronic pain patients with SI arises from the common clinical observation that experiencing chronic pain often requires a revision of one’s life goals and expectations. Hence, the impact of chronic pain is not limited to patients’ biopsychosocial functioning, but it affects the existential domain as well. The major clinical implications in suicidal patients with chronic pain consist in trying to (1) delineate a more precise and individualized suicide risk profile, (2) improve detection and prevention strategies by investigating SI also in individuals who do not present with a clinically diagnosed depression, and (3) enhance the panel of interventions by broadening supportive or psychotherapeutic actions, taking into consideration the existential condition of a person who suffers and strives to deal with his or her suffering.

In most studies, associations between chronic pain and suicidality are robust, even after adjusting for the effect of sociodemographics and psychiatric comorbidity, and particularly for depressive conditions. A number of specific conditions that can modulate suicidality risk in patients with chronic pain have been investigated, but there is a need for their more specific characterization. Numerous recent studies have shown that demoralization and meaning in life (MiL) constructs affect suicidality as risk and protective factors, respectively. These constructs have been mainly investigated in patients with somatic illness and in community-dwelling individuals who may present with SI or SB independently of a psychiatric diagnosis of depression. However, a paucity of studies investigated them in suicidal patients affected by chronic pain.

Viral Inhibition of the IFN-Induced JAK/STAT Signalling Pathway: Development of Live Attenuated Vaccines by Mutation of Viral-Encoded IFN-Antagonists,"The interferon (IFN) induced anti-viral response is amongst the earliest and most potent of the innate responses to fight viral infection. The induction of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway by IFNs leads to the upregulation of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) for which, many have the ability to rapidly kill viruses within infected cells. During the long course of evolution, viruses have evolved an extraordinary range of strategies to counteract the host immune responses in particular by targeting the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. Understanding how the IFN system is inhibited has provided critical insights into viral virulence and pathogenesis.

Two Sides of Emotion: Exploring Positivity and Negativity in Six Basic Emotions across Cultures,"We employ a novel paradigm to test whether six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness; Ekman, 1992) contain both negativity and positivity, as opposed to consisting of a single continuum between negative and positive. We examined the perceived negativity and positivity of these emotions in terms of their affective and cognitive components among Korean, Chinese, Canadian, and American students. Assessing each emotion at the cognitive and affective levels cross-culturally provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the positivity and negativity of emotions. Affective components were rated as more divergent than cognitive components. Cross-culturally, Americans and Canadians gave higher valence ratings to the salient valence of each emotion, and lower ratings to the non-salient valence of an emotion, compared to Chinese and Koreans. The results suggest that emotions encompass both positivity and negativity, and there were cross-cultural differences in reported emotions. This paradigm complements existing emotion theories, building on past research and allowing for more parsimonious explanations of cross-cultural research on emotion.",0,"Two Sides of Emotion: Exploring Positivity and Negativity in Six Basic Emotions across Cultures We employ a novel paradigm to test whether six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness; Ekman, 1992) contain both negativity and positivity, as opposed to consisting of a single continuum between negative and positive.

"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice on Antibiotics and Its Resistance: A Two-Phase Mixed-Methods Online Study among Pakistani Community Pharmacists to Promote Rational Antibiotic Use","Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is an emerging global threat to public health. Substantial evidence has indicated that community pharmacists (CPs) can play a critical role in managing the ever-increasing threat of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practices of CPs (n = 180) towards antibiotics and antibiotic resistance as well as to improve the rational use of antibiotics. A two-phase mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) online study was conducted in Pakistan from August 2019 to March 2020 by using validated questionnaires and semi-structured interview data. Different statistical methods were used to tabulate the quantitative data, whereas inductive thematic analysis was conducted to categorize themes from the qualitative data and to draw conclusions. Approximately 64.4% of the CPs were male (mean: 29–33 years old). Overall, CPs had good knowledge of and were familiar with multidrug-resistant organisms and their roles in ABR (65.6%, median = 1, and IQR = 1), although their knowledge was poor in differentiating some antibiotic groups with their respective ABR patterns (31.1%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). Most CPs have a positive attitude towards antibiotics, with most (90.0%) identifying ABR as a critical issue in public health (median = 1 and IQR = 0). Overall, CPs’ practices towards antibiotics were somewhat acceptable, where they leaned towards educating patients about the rational use of antibiotics (52.8%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). The two main themes discovered (antibiotics and counseling of patients) were related to self-medication, while educational intervention is the main subtheme. ABR is multifactorial, with subthemes related to budget, time constraints, incompetent staff, the absence of CPs, the lack of training, and the enforcement of laws and regulations being the needs of the hour in Pakistan. Effective antibiotic stewardship programs, patient education, and awareness campaigns about antibiotics and ABR along with training of the CPs are important factors that have to be addressed in a timely manner.",0,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice on Antibiotics and Its Resistance: A Two-Phase Mixed-Methods Online Study among Pakistani Community Pharmacists to Promote Rational Antibiotic Use Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is an emerging global threat to public health.

Transpulmonary thermodilution detects rapid and reversible increases in lung water induced by positive end-expiratory pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome,"PURPOSE: It has been suggested that, by recruiting lung regions and enlarging the distribution volume of the cold indicator, increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may lead to an artefactual overestimation of extravascular lung water (EVLW) by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD). METHODS: In 60 ARDS patients, we measured EVLW (PiCCO2 device) at a PEEP level set to reach a plateau pressure of 30 cmH(2)O (HighPEEP(start)) and 15 and 45 min after decreasing PEEP to 5 cmH(2)O (LowPEEP(15′) and LowPEEP(45′), respectively). Then, we increased PEEP back to the baseline level (HighPEEP(end)). Between HighPEEP(start) and LowPEEP(15′), we estimated the degree of lung derecruitment either by measuring changes in the compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) in the whole population, or by measuring the lung derecruited volume in 30 patients. We defined patients with a large derecruitment from the other ones as patients in whom the Crs changes and the measured derecruited volume were larger than the median of these variables observed in the whole population. RESULTS: Reducing PEEP from HighPEEP(start) (14 ± 2 cmH(2)O) to LowPEEP(15′) significantly decreased EVLW from 20 ± 4 to 18 ± 4 mL/kg, central venous pressure (CVP) from 15 ± 4 to 12 ± 4 mmHg, the arterial oxygen tension over inspired oxygen fraction (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio from 184 ± 76 to 150 ± 69 mmHg and lung volume by 144 [68–420] mL. The EVLW decrease was similar in “large derecruiters” and the other patients. When PEEP was re-increased to HighPEEP(end), CVP, PaO(2)/FiO(2) and EVLW significantly re-increased. At linear mixed effect model, EVLW changes were significantly determined only by changes in PEEP and CVP (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively, n = 60). When the same analysis was performed by estimating recruitment according to lung volume changes (n = 30), CVP remained significantly associated to the changes in EVLW (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ARDS patients, changing the PEEP level induced parallel, small and reversible changes in EVLW. These changes were not due to an artefact of the TPTD technique and were likely due to the PEEP-induced changes in CVP, which is the backward pressure of the lung lymphatic drainage.

Level-Set Segmentation-Based Respiratory Volume Estimation Using a Depth Camera,"In this paper, a method is proposed to measure human respiratory volume using a depth camera. The level-set segmentation method, combined with spatial and temporal information, was used to measure respiratory volume accurately. The shape of the human chest wall was used as spatial information. As temporal information, the segmentation result from the previous frame in the time-aligned depth image was used. The results of the proposed method were verified using a ventilator. The proposed method was also compared with other level-set methods. The result showed that the mean tidal volume error of the proposed method was 8.41% compared to the actual tidal volume. This was calculated to have less error than with two other methods: the level-set method with spatial information (14.34%) and the level-set method with temporal information (10.93%). The difference between these methods of tidal volume error was statistically significant [Formula: see text].

"Taxonomy of the Peperomia species (Piperaceae) with pseudo‐epiphyllous inflorescences, including four new species","Twelve of the estimated 1500–1700 taxa in Peperomia show a particular feature: their terminal inflorescences seem to originate from the base of a leaf blade as a result of the presence of a sessile leaf at the base of these inflorescences. Three of these 12 taxa occur in Ecuador and four species are reported from Colombia. From Peru, two species are known from historical herbarium collections, and three other species are new to science. One new species is described from Bolivia. Collections of all 12 species are quite rare and, in the past, their identification seems to have been rather problematic. Previous authors have referred to these inflorescences as epiphyllous but, as shown here, this is not a correct description. To make a clear distinction from genuine epiphyllous inflorescences, the term ‘pseudo‐epiphyllous’ is proposed. In addition to the publication of four new species of Peperomia, emended descriptions are provided for the other species, synonymy is treated, and lectotypes are designated.

The Role of Zinc and Copper in Gynecological Malignancies,"Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are essential microelements, which take part in cellular metabolism, feature in enzymatic systems, and regulate enzyme activity. Homeostasis of these micronutrients is tightly regulated by multiple compensatory mechanisms that balance their concentrations including transporters, importers, and metallothioneins. An altered intake of only one of these trace elements may cause an imbalance in their levels and result in their competition for absorption. Relatively low levels of zinc and increased levels of copper may result in an increased level of oxidative stress and impair the antioxidant properties of multiple enzymes. Altered levels of trace elements were discovered in various pathologies including immunological, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, due to the role of Zn and Cu in oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, they were found to influence cancerogenesis. We review the roles of zinc and copper and their mechanisms in tumor growth, metastasis potential, microenvironment remodeling, and drug resistance. We highlight their role as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, concentrating on their impact on gynecological malignancies.",0,"The Role of Zinc and Copper in Gynecological Malignancies Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are essential microelements, which take part in cellular metabolism, feature in enzymatic systems, and regulate enzyme activity.

"Paediatric apnoeas are not related to a specific respiratory virus, and parental reports predict hospitalisation","AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of apnoeas in previously healthy young infants with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) and correlate their occurrence with isolated micro‐organisms, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome. METHODS: We performed reverse transcriptase real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) on the nasal wash specimens of a prospective cohort study of 582 children with ARI. Clinical data on a subgroup of 241 infants under three months of age, with and without apnoeas, were compared. RESULTS: Our study found that 19 (7.9%) of the 241 infants under three months old had a history of apnoeas: eight had a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), five had a different virus than RSV and seven RT‐PCR results were negative. Infants with apnoeas were more likely to have cyanosis, had longer hospital stays and required extra oxygen for a longer period. Most patients with parental reported apnoeas also experienced apnoeas during hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: This study observed apnoeas irrespective of the isolated micro‐organism, and we hypothesise that they were related to the pathophysiology of the respiratory infection and not to the micro‐organism itself. Parental reported apnoeas were a major warning sign and predicted that apnoeas would occur in hospital.",0,"Paediatric apnoeas are not related to a specific respiratory virus, and parental reports predict hospitalisation AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of apnoeas in previously healthy young infants with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) and correlate their occurrence with isolated micro‐organisms, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome.

The Role of the Plant Nucleolus in Pre-mRNA Processing,"The nucleolus is a multifunctional compartment of the eukaryotic nucleus. Besides its well-recognised role in transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA and the assembly of ribosomal subunits, the nucleolus has functions in the processing and assembly of a variety of RNPs and is involved in cell cycle control and senescence and as a sensor of stress. Historically, nucleoli have been tenuously linked to the biogenesis and, in particular, export of mRNAs in yeast and mammalian cells. Recently, data from plants have extended the functions in which the plant nucleolus is involved to include transcriptional gene silencing as well as mRNA surveillance and nonsense-mediated decay, and mRNA export.

Transgenic plants for animal health: plant-made vaccine antigens for animal infectious disease control,"A variety of plant species have been genetically modified to accumulate vaccine antigens for human and animal health and the first vaccine candidates are approaching the market. The regulatory burden for animal vaccines is less than that for human use and this has attracted the attention of researchers and companies, and investment in plant-made vaccines for animal infectious disease control is increasing. The dosage cost of vaccines for animal infectious diseases must be kept to a minimum, especially for non-lethal diseases that diminish animal welfare and growth, so efficient and economic production, storage and delivery are critical for commercialization. It has become clear that transgenic plants are an economic and efficient alternative to fermentation for large-scale production of vaccine antigens. The oral delivery of plant-made vaccines is particularly attractive since the expensive purification step can be avoided further reducing the cost per dose.

The Evolutionary Pattern of Glycosylation Sites in Influenza Virus (H5N1) Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase,"Two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), on the surface of influenza viruses play crucial roles in transfaunation, membrane fusion and the release of progeny virions. To explore the distribution of N-glycosylation sites (glycosites) in these two glycoproteins, we collected and aligned the amino acid sequences of all the HA and NA subtypes. Two glycosites were located at HA0 cleavage sites and fusion peptides and were strikingly conserved in all HA subtypes, while the remaining glycosites were unique to their subtypes. Two to four conserved glycosites were found in the stalk domain of NA, but these are affected by the deletion of specific stalk domain sequences. Another highly conserved glycosite appeared at the top center of tetrameric global domain, while the others glycosites were distributed around the global domain. Here we present a detailed investigation of the distribution and the evolutionary pattern of the glycosites in the envelope glycoproteins of IVs, and further focus on the H5N1 virus and conclude that the glycosites in H5N1 have become more complicated in HA and less influential in NA in the last five years.",0,"The Evolutionary Pattern of Glycosylation Sites in Influenza Virus (H5N1) Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase Two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), on the surface of influenza viruses play crucial roles in transfaunation, membrane fusion and the release of progeny virions.

The Respiratory Specimen Collection Trial (ReSpeCT): A Randomized Controlled Trial to Compare Quality and Timeliness of Respiratory Sample Collection in the Home by Parents and Healthcare Workers From Children Aged <2 Years,"BACKGROUND: Most acute respiratory infection (ARI) research focuses on severe disease and overlooks the burden of community-managed illness. For community-based studies, home-based specimen collection by parents could be a resource-saving alternative to collection by healthcare workers (HCWs). In this study, we compared parent and HCW groups for their likelihood to collect specimens and the timeliness and quality of such collection. METHODS: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, parents from Brisbane, Australia, were taught to identify new ARI episodes in their children aged <2 years. When their child had a new ARI, parents either collected a nasal swab from the child (P group) or contacted an HCW who visited to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab (HCW group). We compared the likelihood and timeliness of specimen collection and respiratory pathogen detection. A nested diagnostic study compared paired specimen collections from children in the HCW group. RESULTS: Included were 76 incident ARI episodes from 31 children and 102 episodes from 33 children in the P and HCW groups, respectively. The proportions of ARIs for which a specimen was collected were similar (P group, 69.7%; HCW group, 72.5%; P = .77), and pathogens were detected in 93.8% and 77.5% of the specimens, respectively (P = .03). The period between ARI onset and specimen collection was shorter in the P group than in the HCW group (mean difference, 1.9 days [95% confidence interval, 0.7–3.0 days]; P < .001). For the 69 paired specimens, viral loads were lower in the parent-collected swabs (mean cycle threshold difference, 4.5 [95% confidence interval, 3.1–5.9]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Parents and HCWs obtained samples in similar proportions of ARI episodes, but the parents collected the samples fewer days after ARI onset and with a resulting higher likelihood of pathogen identification. This method can be used in population-based epidemiological studies of ARI as a resource-saving alternative.

New Cysteine Protease Inhibitors: Electrophilic (Het)arenes and Unexpected Prodrug Identification for the Trypanosoma Protease Rhodesain,"Electrophilic (het)arenes can undergo reactions with nucleophiles yielding π- or Meisenheimer (σ-) complexes or the products of the S(N)Ar addition/elimination reactions. Such building blocks have only rarely been employed for the design of enzyme inhibitors. Herein, we demonstrate the combination of a peptidic recognition sequence with such electrophilic (het)arenes to generate highly active inhibitors of disease-relevant proteases. We further elucidate an unexpected mode of action for the trypanosomal protease rhodesain using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, enzyme kinetics and various types of simulations. After hydrolysis of an ester function in the recognition sequence of a weakly active prodrug inhibitor, the liberated carboxylic acid represents a highly potent inhibitor of rhodesain (K(i) = 4.0 nM). The simulations indicate that, after the cleavage of the ester, the carboxylic acid leaves the active site and re-binds to the enzyme in an orientation that allows the formation of a very stable π-complex between the catalytic dyad (Cys-25/His-162) of rhodesain and the electrophilic aromatic moiety. The reversible inhibition mode results because the S(N)Ar reaction, which is found in an alkaline solvent containing a low molecular weight thiol, is hindered within the enzyme due to the presence of the positively charged imidazolium ring of His-162. Comparisons between measured and calculated NMR shifts support this interpretation.",0,"New Cysteine Protease Inhibitors: Electrophilic (Het)arenes and Unexpected Prodrug Identification for the Trypanosoma Protease Rhodesain Electrophilic (het)arenes can undergo reactions with nucleophiles yielding π- or Meisenheimer (σ-) complexes or the products of the S(N)Ar addition/elimination reactions. Such building blocks have only rarely been employed for the design of enzyme inhibitors. Herein, we demonstrate the combination of a peptidic recognition sequence with such electrophilic (het)arenes to generate highly active inhibitors of disease-relevant proteases. We further elucidate an unexpected mode of action for the trypanosomal protease rhodesain using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, enzyme kinetics and various types of simulations. After hydrolysis of an ester function in the recognition sequence of a weakly active prodrug inhibitor, the liberated carboxylic acid represents a highly potent inhibitor of rhodesain (K(i) = 4.0 nM).

The Modeling of Global Epidemics: Stochastic Dynamics and Predictability,"The global spread of emergent diseases is inevitably entangled with the structure of the population flows among different geographical regions. The airline transportation network in particular shrinks the geographical space by reducing travel time between the world's most populated areas and defines the main channels along which emergent diseases will spread. In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks.",0,"The Modeling of Global Epidemics: Stochastic Dynamics and Predictability The global spread of emergent diseases is inevitably entangled with the structure of the population flows among different geographical regions.

The calculation of information and organismal complexity,"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to measure precisely the phenotypic complexity of living organisms. Here we propose a method to calculate the minimal amount of genomic information needed to construct organism (effective information) as a measure of organismal complexity, by using permutation and combination formulas and Shannon's information concept. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the calculated information correlates quite well with the intuitive organismal phenotypic complexity defined by traditional taxonomy and evolutionary theory. From viruses to human beings, the effective information gradually increases, from thousands of bits to hundreds of millions of bits. The simpler the organism is, the less the information; the more complex the organism, the more the information. About 13% of human genome is estimated as effective information or functional sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The effective information can be used as a quantitative measure of phenotypic complexity of living organisms and also as an estimate of functional fraction of genome.

Structures of the four Ig-like domain LILRB2 and the four-domain LILRB1 and HLA-G1 complex,"Leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (LILRs), also known as CD85 and immunoglobulin-like transcripts (ILTs), play pivotal roles in regulating immune responses. These receptors define an immune checkpoint that immune therapy can target. Through cis or trans interactions with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G, the two most abundantly expressed inhibitory LILRs, LILRB1, and LILRB2 (LILRB1/2, also known as CD85j/d and ILT2/4), are involved in immunotolerance in pregnancy and transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and immune evasion by tumors. Although the discrete domains of LILRB1/2 are clear, the assembly mode of the four extracellular Ig-like domains (D1, D2, D3, and D4) remains unknown. Previous data indicate that D1D2 is responsible for binding to HLA class I (HLA-I), but the roles of D3D4 are still unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the four Ig-like domain LILRB2 and four-domain LILRB1 in complex with HLA-G1. The angles between adjacent domains and the staggered assembly of the four domains suggest limited flexibility and limited plasticity of the receptors during ligand binding. The complex structure of four-domain LILRB1 and HLA-G1 supports the model that D1D2 is responsible for HLA-I binding, while D3D4 acts as a scaffold. Accordingly, cis and trans binding models for HLA-I binding to LILRB1/2 are proposed. The geometries of LILRB1/2 in complex with dimeric and monomeric HLA-G1 suggest the accessibility of the dimeric receptor, which in turn, transduces more inhibitory signals. The assembly of LILRB1/2 and its binding to HLA-G1 could aid in the design of immune regulators and benefit immune interference.",0,"Structures of the four Ig-like domain LILRB2 and the four-domain LILRB1 and HLA-G1 complex Leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (LILRs), also known as CD85 and immunoglobulin-like transcripts (ILTs), play pivotal roles in regulating immune responses.

Neutrophils Turn Plasma Proteins into Weapons against HIV-1,"As a consequence of innate immune activation granulocytes and macrophages produce hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid (HOCl) via secretion of myeloperoxidase (MPO) to the outside of the cells, where HOCl immediately reacts with proteins. Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV-1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, and to its receptor CD4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p24 in the culture supernatant. The unmodified plasma protein fraction had no effect. HOCl-altered isolated proteins antithrombin III and human serum albumin, taken as representative examples of the whole pool of plasma proteins, were both able to exert the same activity of binding to gp120 and inhibition of viral proliferation. These data offer an opportunity to improve the understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and allow the generation of the following hypothetical scheme: natural immune defense mechanisms generate by posttranslational modification of plasma proteins a potent virucidal weapon that immobilizes the virus as well as inhibits viral fusion and thus entry into the host cells.

Assessment of adverse events related to anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitors using the FDA adverse event reporting system and online patient reviews,"The recommended antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prevention of influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate age-related clinical manifestations of adverse events (AEs) related to NAIs. FAERS and WebMD data were downloaded. The available NAIs selected for the analysis were oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir.

Progranulin deficiency confers resistance to autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice,"Progranulin is a secreted neurotrophin that assists in the autophagolysosomal pathways that contribute to MHC-mediated antigen processing, pathogen removal, and autoimmunity. We showed that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have high levels of circulating progranulin and that its depletion in a mouse model by a monoclonal antibody aggravates MS-like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, unexpectedly, progranulin-deficient mice (Grn(−/−)) were resistant to EAE, and this resistance was fully restored by wild-type bone marrow transplantation. FACS analyses revealed a loss of MHC-II-positive antigen-presenting cells in Grn(−/−) mice and a reduction in the number of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells along with a strong increase in the number of scavenger receptor class B (CD36+) phagocytes, suggesting defects in antigen presentation along with a compensatory increase in phagocytosis. Indeed, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from Grn(−/−) mice showed stronger uptake of antigens but failed to elicit antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. An increase in the number of CD36+ phagocytes was associated with increased local inflammation at the site of immunization, stronger stimulation-evoked morphological transformation of bone marrow-derived macrophages to phagocytes, an increase in the phagocytosis of E. coli particles and latex beads and defects in the clearance of the material. Hence, the outcomes in the EAE model reflect the dichotomy of progranulin-mediated immune silencing and autoimmune mechanisms of antigen recognition and presentation, and our results reveal a novel progranulin-dependent pathway in autoimmune encephalomyelitis.",0,"Progranulin deficiency confers resistance to autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice Progranulin is a secreted neurotrophin that assists in the autophagolysosomal pathways that contribute to MHC-mediated antigen processing, pathogen removal, and autoimmunity.

Increased susceptibility of aged rats to haemorrhage and intravascular hypercoagulation following endotoxin administered in a generalized Shwartzman regime,"Ageing rats are known to have an increased incidence of myocardial fibrosis and dyspnoea caused by pulmonary intravascular coagulation. In order to determine whether endotoxin can be responsible for such responses in ageing rats we have exposed rats of differing ages (2 months, 16 months and 24 months) to single or repeated (two doses 24 h apart; generalized Shwartzman regime) intravenous doses of endotoxin (E. coli 0111134). Only the 2-year-old rats reacted adversely. Two doses of endotoxin produced death, with focal myocardial necrosis, haemorrhage and pulmonary and hepatic intravascular coagulation. The increased susceptibility of aged rats to the toxic effects of endotoxin explains some of the changes found in the tissues of old rats. The sporadic nature of both cardiac failure and dyspnoea as a cause of morbidity and mortality in ageing rats may be related to the need for two endotoxin episodes in a period of 24 h to provoke a generalized Shwartzman reaction, an occurrence likely to be relatively uncommon under natural conditions.",0,"Increased susceptibility of aged rats to haemorrhage and intravascular hypercoagulation following endotoxin administered in a generalized Shwartzman regime Ageing rats are known to have an increased incidence of myocardial fibrosis and dyspnoea caused by pulmonary intravascular coagulation.

A predictive decision-aid methodology for dynamic mitigation of influenza pandemics,"In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine has stressed the need for dynamic mitigation strategies for pandemic influenza. In response to the need, we have developed a simulation-based optimization methodology for generating dynamic predictive mitigation strategies for pandemic outbreaks affecting several regions. Our methodology can accommodate varying virus and population dynamics. It progressively allocates a limited budget to procure vaccines and antivirals, capacities for their administration, and resources required to enforce social distancing. The methodology uses measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, which are translated into the costs of lost productivity and medical services. The simulation model was calibrated using historic pandemic data. We illustrate the use of our methodology on a mock outbreak involving over four million people residing in four major population centers in Florida, USA. A sensitivity analysis is presented to estimate the impact of changes in the budget availability and variability of some of the critical parameters of mitigation strategies. The methodology is intended to assist public health policy makers.",0,"A predictive decision-aid methodology for dynamic mitigation of influenza pandemics In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine has stressed the need for dynamic mitigation strategies for pandemic influenza.

Variability of contact process in complex networks,"We study numerically how the structures of distinct networks influence the epidemic dynamics in contact process. We first find that the variability difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is very narrow, although the heterogeneous structures can induce the lighter prevalence. Contrary to non-community networks, strong community structures can cause the secondary outbreak of prevalence and two peaks of variability appeared. Especially in the local community, the extraordinarily large variability in early stage of the outbreak makes the prediction of epidemic spreading hard. Importantly, the bridgeness plays a significant role in the predictability, meaning the further distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness, the less accurate the predictability is. Also, we investigate the effect of different disease reaction mechanisms on variability, and find that the different reaction mechanisms will result in the distinct variabilities at the end of epidemic spreading.",0,"Variability of contact process in complex networks We study numerically how the structures of distinct networks influence the epidemic dynamics in contact process.

Topical povidone iodine inhibits bacterial growth in the oral cavity of patients on mechanical ventilation: a randomized controlled study,"BACKGROUND: Topical 0.12% chlorhexidine has been used widely to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. However, it is not approved for mucosal application in Japan. The aims of this study were to investigate if topical povidone iodine (i) inhibits bacterial growth and (ii) disrupts the balance of the oral microbiota. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 23 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the intervention group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 7). All patients received oral cleaning with 3% hydrogen peroxide, followed by irrigation with tap water. The patients in the intervention group received 10% povidone iodine applied topically to the oral cavity. The concentration of total bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid were determined before, immediately after, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after oral care using the Rapid Oral Bacteria Quantification System, which is based on dielectrophoresis and impedance measurements. The number of streptococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans before, immediately after, 1 h, and 3 h after oral care were estimated based on real-time polymerase chain reaction data. RESULTS: After irrigation of the oral cavity, the number of bacteria decreased, but increased again at 1 h after oral care in the control group; however, in the intervention group, the concentration of bacteria was significantly lower than that in the control group at 1 hour (p = 0.009), 2 h (p = 0.001), and 3 h (p = 0.001) after oral care. The growth of all bacterial species tested was inhibited in the intervention group at 3 h after oral care, suggesting that povidone iodine did not disturb the balance of the oral microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of povidone iodine after cleaning and irrigation of the oral cavity inhibited bacterial growth in the oropharyngeal fluid of patients on mechanical ventilation while not disrupting the balance of the oral microbiota.

Rebalancing of the gut flora and microbial metabolism is responsible for the anti-arthritis effect of kaempferol,"Kaempferol is a natural flavonol that possesses various pharmacological activities, including anti-arthritis effects, yet the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. To evaluate the anti-arthritis efficacy and the underlying mechanisms of kaempferol, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were treated with kaempferol intragastrically (200 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)) and intraperitoneally (20 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1)). Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies showed that the oral administration of kaempferol produced distinct anti-arthritis effects in model mice with arthritis in terms of the spleen index, arthritis index, paw thickness, and inflammatory factors; the bioavailability (1.5%, relative to that of the intraperitoneal injection) and circulatory exposure of kaempferol (C(max) = 0.23 ± 0.06 ng/mL) and its primary metabolite kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide (C(max) = 233.29 ± 89.64 ng/mL) were rather low. In contrast, the intraperitoneal injection of kaempferol caused marginal anti-arthritis effects, although it achieved a much higher in vivo exposure. The much higher kaempferol content in the gut implicated a potential mechanism involved in the gut. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA revealed that CIA caused imbalance of 14 types of bacteria at the family level, whereas kaempferol largely rebalanced the intestinal microbiota in CIA mice. A metabolomics study showed that kaempferol treatment significantly reversed the perturbation of metabolites involved in energy production and the tryptophan, fatty acid and secondary bile acid metabolisms in the gut contents of the CIA mice.

Anti-Sarcocystis Antibodies in Lambs Deprived of Colostrum,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of anti-Sarcocystis spp. specific IgG antibodies in serum samples from precolostral lambs to determine the occurrence of transplacental transmission of Sarcocystis spp. in sheep. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 80 ewes and their respective lambs, immediately after lambing and before colostrum ingestion, respectively. The presence of anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was evaluated in serum samples using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Positive samples of the lambs were submitted to titration and IFAT to detect anti-T. gondii and anti-N. caninum specific IgG. RESULTS: Anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was detected in 62.5% of the ewes (50/80) and in 4% of the lambs of the seropositive ewes (2/50). None of the lambs from seronegative ewes were positive. The final titers of the positive lambs were 80. No cross reaction was detected among the positive samples to anti-Sarcocystis spp., anti-N. caninum, and anti-T. gondii IgG.

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 80 ewes and their respective lambs, immediately after lambing and before colostrum ingestion, respectively. The presence of anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was evaluated in serum samples using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Positive samples of the lambs were submitted to titration and IFAT to detect anti-T. gondii and anti-N. caninum specific IgG. RESULTS: Anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was detected in 62.5% of the ewes (50/80) and in 4% of the lambs of the seropositive ewes (2/50). None of the lambs from seronegative ewes were positive. The final titers of the positive lambs were 80. No cross reaction was detected among the positive samples to anti-Sarcocystis spp., anti-N. caninum, and anti-T. gondii IgG. The detection of anti-Sarcocystis spp. antibodies in serum samples of lambs deprived of colostrum suggests transplacental transmission of infection.

Cations Regulate Membrane Attachment and Functionality of DNA Nanostructures,"[Image: see text] The interplay between nucleic acids and lipids underpins several key processes in molecular biology, synthetic biotechnology, vaccine technology, and nanomedicine. These interactions are often electrostatic in nature, and much of their rich phenomenology remains unexplored in view of the chemical diversity of lipids, the heterogeneity of their phases, and the broad range of relevant solvent conditions. Here we unravel the electrostatic interactions between zwitterionic lipid membranes and DNA nanostructures in the presence of physiologically relevant cations, with the purpose of identifying new routes to program DNA–lipid complexation and membrane-active nanodevices. We demonstrate that this interplay is influenced by both the phase of the lipid membranes and the valency of the ions and observe divalent cation bridging between nucleic acids and gel-phase bilayers. Furthermore, even in the presence of hydrophobic modifications on the DNA, we find that cations are still required to enable DNA adhesion to liquid-phase membranes. We show that the latter mechanism can be exploited to control the degree of attachment of cholesterol-modified DNA nanostructures by modifying their overall hydrophobicity and charge. Besides their biological relevance, the interaction mechanisms we explored hold great practical potential in the design of biomimetic nanodevices, as we show by constructing an ion-regulated DNA-based synthetic enzyme.",0,"Cations Regulate Membrane Attachment and Functionality of DNA Nanostructures [Image: see text] The interplay between nucleic acids and lipids underpins several key processes in molecular biology, synthetic biotechnology, vaccine technology, and nanomedicine.

Mutation of N-glycosylation Sites in Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) Envelope Proteins Attenuate the Virus in Cell Culture,"Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is the cause of pancreas disease and sleeping disease in farmed salmonid fish in Europe. The spread of these diseases has been difficult to control with biosecurity and current vaccination strategies, and increased understanding of the viral pathogenesis could be beneficial for the development of novel vaccine strategies. N-glycosylation of viral envelope proteins may be crucial for viral virulence and a possible target for its purposed attenuation. In this study, we mutated the N-glycosylation consensus motifs of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of a SAV3 infectious clone using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of the glycosylation motif in E1 gave a complete inactivation of the virus as no viral replication could be detected in cell culture and infectious particles could not be rescued. In contrast, infectious virus particles could be recovered from the SAV3 E2 mutants (E2319Q, E2319A), but not if they were accompanied by lack of N-glycosylation in E1. Compared to the non-mutated infectious clone, the SAV3-E2319Q and SAV3-E2319A recombinant viruses produced less cytopathic effects in cell culture and lower amounts of infectious viral particles. In conclusion, the substitution in the N-linked glycosylation site in E2 attenuated SAV3 in cell culture. The findings could be useful for immunization strategies using live attenuated vaccines and testing in fish will be desirable to study the clone’s properties in vivo.",0,"Mutation of N-glycosylation Sites in Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) Envelope Proteins Attenuate the Virus in Cell Culture Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is the cause of pancreas disease and sleeping disease in farmed salmonid fish in Europe.

Probable reassortment of genomic elements among elongated RNA-containing plant viruses,"The relationships of genome organization among elongated (rod-shaped and filamentous) plant viruses have been analyzed. Sequences in coding and noncoding regions of barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) RNAs 1, 2, and 3 were compared with those of the monopartite RNA genomes of potato virus X (PVX), white clover mosaic virus (WClMV), and tobacco mosaic virus, the bipartite genome of tobacco rattle virus (TRV), the quadripartite genome of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), and icosahedral tricornaviruses. These plant viruses belong to a supergroup having 5′-capped genomic RNAs. The results suggest that the genomic elements in each BSMV RNA are phylogenetically related to those of different plant RNA viruses. RNA 1 resembles the corresponding RNA 1 of tricornaviruses. The putative proteins encoded in BSMV RNA 2 are related to the products of BNYVV RNA 2, PVX RNA, and WClMV RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that BSMV RNA 3 resembles TRV RNA 1. Also, it can be proposed that in the case of monopartite genomes, as a rule, every gene or block of genes retains phylogenetic relationships that are independent of adjacent genomic elements of the same RNA. Such differential evolution of individual elements of one and the same viral genome implies a prominent role for gene reassortment in the formation of viral genetic systems.",0,"Probable reassortment of genomic elements among elongated RNA-containing plant viruses The relationships of genome organization among elongated (rod-shaped and filamentous) plant viruses have been analyzed.

A review of Phase I trials of Ebola virus vaccines: what can we learn from the race to develop novel vaccines?,"Sporadic outbreaks of Ebola virus infection have been documented since the mid-Seventies and viral exposure can lead to lethal haemorrhagic fever with case fatalities as high as 90%. There is now a comprehensive body of data from both ongoing and completed clinical trials assessing various vaccine strategies, which were rapidly advanced through clinical trials in response to the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) public health emergency. Careful consideration of immunogenicity post vaccination is essential but has been somewhat stifled because of the wide array of immunological assays and outputs that have been used in the numerous clinical trials. We discuss here the different aspects of the immune assays currently used in the Phase I clinical trials for Ebola virus vaccines, and draw comparisons across the immune outputs where possible; various trials have examined both cellular and humoral immunity in European and African cohorts. Assessment of the safety data, the immunological outputs and the ease of field deployment for the various vaccine modalities will help both the scientific community and policy-makers prioritize and potentially license vaccine candidates. If this can be achieved, the next outbreak of Ebola virus, or other emerging pathogen, can be more readily contained and will not have such widespread and devastating consequences.

Pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography findings in nephropathia epidemica,"PURPOSE: To evaluate lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in patients with Puumala hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica (NE), and to determine if these findings correspond to chest radiograph findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HRCT findings and clinical course were studied in 13 hospital-treated NE patients. Chest radiograph findings were studied in 12 of them. RESULTS: Twelve patients (92%) showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT, while only 8 had changes in their chest radiography. Atelectasis, pleural effusion, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the most common HRCT findings. Ground-glass opacification (GGO) was seen in 4 and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 3 patients. Atelectasis and pleural effusion were also mostly seen in chest radiographs, other findings only in HRCT. CONCLUSION: Almost every NE patient showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT. The most common findings of lung involvement in NE can be defined as accumulation of pleural fluid and atelectasis and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, most profusely in the lower parts of the lung. As a novel finding, lymphadenopathy was seen in a minority, probably related to capillary leakage and overall fluid overload. Pleural effusion is not the prominent feature in other viral pneumonias, whereas intralobular and interlobular septal thickening are characteristic of other viral pulmonary infections as well. Lung parenchymal findings in HRCT can thus be taken not to be disease-specific in NE and HRCT is useful only for scientific purposes.",0,"Pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography findings in nephropathia epidemica PURPOSE: To evaluate lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in patients with Puumala hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica (NE), and to determine if these findings correspond to chest radiograph findings.

Real-time shear wave ultrasound elastography: a new tool for the evaluation of diaphragm and limb muscle stiffness in critically ill patients,"BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness following critical illness is the consequence of loss of muscle mass and alteration of muscle quality. It is associated with long-term disability. Ultrasonography is a reliable tool to quantify muscle mass, but studies that evaluate muscle quality at the critically ill bedside are lacking. Shear wave ultrasound elastography (SWE) provides spatial representation of soft tissue stiffness and measures of muscle quality. The reliability and reproducibility of SWE in critically ill patients has never been evaluated. METHODS: Two operators tested in healthy controls and in critically ill patients the intra- and inter-operator reliability of the SWE using transversal and longitudinal views of the diaphragm and limb muscles. Reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient and a bootstrap sampling method assessed their consistency. RESULTS: We collected 560 images. Longitudinal views of the diaphragm (ICC 0.83 [0.50–0.94]), the biceps brachii (ICC 0.88 [0.67–0.96]) and the rectus femoris (ICC 0.76 [0.34–0.91]) were the most reliable views in a training set of healthy controls. Intra-class correlation coefficient for inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator reliability was above 0.9 for all muscles in a validation set of healthy controls. In critically ill patients, inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator 1 and 2 reliability ICCs were respectively 0.92 [0.71–0.98], 0.93 [0.82–0.98] and 0.92 [0.81–0.98] for the diaphragm; 0.96 [0.86–0.99], 0.98 [0.94–0.99] and 0.99 [0.96–1] for the biceps brachii and 0.91 [0.51–0.98], 0.97 [0.93–0.99] and 0.99 [0.97–1] for the rectus femoris.

"Intention to vaccinate universally against varicella, rotavirus gastroenteritis, meningococcal B disease and seasonal influenza among parents in the Netherlands: an internet survey","OBJECTIVE: For the decision-making process regarding introduction of new vaccines into the National Immunisation Programme (NIP), advance insight into the potential acceptance among the population is relevant. We studied the intention of parents to have their child vaccinated against four diseases not currently covered by the NIP in the Netherlands. The results on varicella have been published before; this article adds the results on vaccination against rotavirus gastroenteritis, meningococcal B disease, and seasonal influenza. RESULTS: We invited a random sample from the national immunisation register of 1500 parents for an internet survey which was completed by 491 parents (33% response). The intention to vaccinate was highest for meningococcal B disease (83% positive intention), followed by rotavirus gastroenteritis (38%), and lowest for varicella (28%) and seasonal influenza (15%). Prediction analyses were performed to determine which out of seven questionnaire statements was most informative in predicting the intention to vaccinate.

Protective effect of gossypol on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice,"OBJECTIVE: Gossypol has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gossypol on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were pretreated with gossypol 1 h before intranasal instillation of LPS. Then, 7 h after LPS administration, the myeloperoxidase in histology of lungs, lung wet/dry ratio and inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the BALF were measured by ELISA. The extent of phosphorylation of IκB-α, p65 NF-κB, p46–p54 JNK, p42–p44 ERK, and p38 were detected by western blot. RESULTS: Gossypol markedly attenuated the LPS-induced histological alterations in the lung and inhibited the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Additionally, gossypol reduced the inflammatory cells in BALF, decreased the wet/dry ratio of lungs and inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB-α, p65 NF-κB, p46–p54 JNK, p42–p44 ERK, and p38 caused by LPS. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that anti-inflammatory effects of gossypol against the LPS-induced ALI may be due to its ability of inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPKs signaling pathways. Gossypol may be a promising potential therapeutic reagent for ALI treatment.",0,"Protective effect of gossypol on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice OBJECTIVE: Gossypol has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties.

Effects of weak ties on epidemic predictability on community networks,"Weak ties play a significant role in the structures and the dynamics of community networks. Based on the contact process, we study numerically how weak ties influence the predictability of epidemic dynamics. We first investigate the effects of the degree of bridge nodes on the variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and find out that the bridge node with a small degree can enhance the predictability of epidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, the variability of the prevalence will display a complete opposite trend to that of the arrival time, as the distance from the initial seed to the bridge node or the degree of the initial seed increases. More specifically, the further distance and the larger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of the arrival time and the worse predictability of the prevalence. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the number of weak ties on the epidemic variability. As the community strength becomes very strong, which is caused by the decrease of the number of weak ties, the epidemic variability will change dramatically. Compared with the case of the hub seed and the random seed, the bridge seed can result in the worst predictability of the arrival time and the best predictability of the prevalence.",0,"Effects of weak ties on epidemic predictability on community networks Weak ties play a significant role in the structures and the dynamics of community networks.

Mediterranean pasture dynamics: the role of germination,Abstract. Meteorological patterns have a decisive influence on the inter‐annual dynamics of therophyte pastures under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The germination behaviour of annual pasture species was studied by subjecting two collections of seeds taken from plants and soil‐seed banks to two phytotron‐simulated weather patterns: early and late autumn rains. Species from these pastures were arranged along a gradient of sensitivity to temperature on the arrival of the first persistent rain. This sensitivity was manifested in both the total germination success of the species and the germination time profile. The different germination patterns of the species can provide competitive advantages depending on the autumn weather conditions.,0,Mediterranean pasture dynamics: the role of germination Abstract.

Short-Term Birth Sequelae of the 1918–1920 Influenza Pandemic in the United States: State-Level Analysis,"This paper examines short-term birth sequelae of the influenza pandemic of 1918–1920 in the United States using monthly data on births and all-cause deaths for 19 US states in conjunction with data on maternal deaths, stillbirths, and premature births. The data on births and all-cause deaths are adjusted for seasonal and trend effects, and the residual components of the 2 time series coinciding with the timing of peak influenza mortality are examined for these sequelae. Notable findings include: 1) a drop in births in the 3 months following peak mortality; 2) a reversion in births to normal levels occurring 5–7 months after peak mortality; and 3) a steep drop in births occurring 9–10 months after peak mortality. Interpreted in the context of parallel data showing elevated premature births, stillbirths, and maternal mortality during times of peak influenza mortality, these findings suggest that the main impacts of the 1918–1920 influenza on reproduction occurred through: 1) impaired conceptions, possibly due to effects on fertility and behavioral changes; 2) an increase in the preterm delivery rate during the peak of the pandemic; and 3) elevated maternal and fetal mortality, resulting in late-term losses in pregnancy.",0,"Short-Term Birth Sequelae of the 1918–1920 Influenza Pandemic in the United States: State-Level Analysis This paper examines short-term birth sequelae of the influenza pandemic of 1918–1920 in the United States using monthly data on births and all-cause deaths for 19 US states in conjunction with data on maternal deaths, stillbirths, and premature births.

"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceived Barriers toward Genetic Testing and Pharmacogenomics among Healthcare Workers in the United Arab Emirates: A Cross-Sectional Study","In order to successfully translate the scientific models of genetic testing and pharmacogenomics into clinical practice, empowering healthcare workers with the right knowledge and functional understanding on the subject is essential. Limited research in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have assessed healthcare worker stances towards genomics. This study aimed to assess healthcare workers’ knowledge and attitudes on genetic testing. A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare workers practicing in either public or private hospitals or clinics as pharmacists, nurses, physicians, managers, and allied health. Participants were recruited randomly and via snowball techniques. Surveys were collected between April and September 2019; out of 552 respondents, 63.4% were female, the mean age was 38 (±9.6) years old. The mean knowledge score was 5.2 (±2.3) out of nine, which shows a fair level of knowledge. The scores of respondents of pharmacy were 5.1 (±2.5), medicine 6.0 (±2.0), and nursing 4.8 (±2.1). All participants exhibited a fair knowledge level about genetic testing and pharmacogenomics. Of the respondents, 91.9% showed a positive attitude regarding availability of genetic testing. The top identified barrier to implementation was the cost of testing (62%), followed by lack of training or education and insurance coverage (57.8% and 57.2%, respectively). Building upon the positive attitudes and tackling the barriers and challenges will pave the road for full implementation of genetic testing and pharmacogenomics in the UAE. We recommend empowering healthcare workers by improving needed and tailored competencies related to their area of practice. We strongly urge the stakeholders to streamline and benchmark the workflow, algorithm, and guidelines to standardize the health and electronic system. Lastly, we advocate utilizing technology and electronic decision support as well as the translational report to back up healthcare workers in the UAE.",0,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceived Barriers toward Genetic Testing and Pharmacogenomics among Healthcare Workers in the United Arab Emirates: A Cross-Sectional Study In order to successfully translate the scientific models of genetic testing and pharmacogenomics into clinical practice, empowering healthcare workers with the right knowledge and functional understanding on the subject is essential.

Is the risk of multiple sclerosis related to the ‘biography’ of the immune system?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) with onset in childhood offers a unique opportunity to study the infectious background of this disease but the immune reactions against infectious agents in such children have only recently been investigated. These and other epidemiological studies strongly implicate involvement of one or more infectious agents in the aetiology of MS, with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) being the prime candidate. Rather than being the actual cause of MS, it is more probable that these agents are involved in the development of immunoregulatory pathways. These pathways, if disturbed by hygiene-related factors including an altered sequence of infections, may generate and maintain a deficit within the immunological network that facilitates, to particular early events in the development of MS, preceding the onset of MS disease by years or a decade. A framework that can serve as a guide for further epidemiological, immunologic and molecular biologic investigations is formulated. This approach may shed light on the complex natural history of MS and may lead to rational preventive and therapeutic strategies. It is possible that, in the future, MS could be prevented by vaccination against EBV in early childhood; the framework is of relevance to the design of an appropriate type of vaccine.",0,"Is the risk of multiple sclerosis related to the ‘biography’ of the immune system?

GSH rescue by N-acetylcysteine,"Reduced glutathione (GSH) is the main intracellular low molecular weight thiol. GSH acts as a nucleophilic scavenger and as an enzyme-catalyzed antioxidant in the event of electrophilic/oxidative tissue injury. Therefore, GSH has a major role as a protector of biological structures and functions. GSH depletion has been recognized as a hazardous condition during paracetamol intoxication. Conversely, GSH rescue, meaning recovery of the protective potential of GSH by early administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been found to be life-saving. Lack of GSH and electrophilic/oxidative injury have been identified among the causes of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Experimental and early clinical data (in ARDS) point to the role of NAC in the treatment of these conditions. Recently, orally given NAC has been shown to enhance the levels of GSH in the liver, in plasma, and notably in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Rescue of GSH through NAC needs to be appreciated as an independent treatment modality for an array of different diseases, all of which have one feature in common: pathogenetically relevant loss of GSH.",0,"GSH rescue by N-acetylcysteine Reduced glutathione (GSH) is the main intracellular low molecular weight thiol.

The development of a post-mortem interval estimation for human remains found on land in the Netherlands,"The decomposition process of human remains can be used to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI), but decomposition varies due to many factors. Temperature is believed to be the most important and can be connected to decomposition by using the accumulated degree days (ADD). The aim of this research was to develop a decomposition scoring method and to develop a formula to estimate the PMI by using the developed decomposition scoring method and ADD. A decomposition scoring method and a Book of Reference (visual resource) were made. Ninety-one cases were used to develop a method to estimate the PMI. The photographs were scored using the decomposition scoring method. The temperature data was provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The PMI was estimated using the total decomposition score (TDS) and using the TDS and ADD. The latter required an additional step, namely to calculate the ADD from the finding date back until the predicted day of death. The developed decomposition scoring method had a high interrater reliability. The TDS significantly estimates the PMI (R (2) = 0.67 and 0.80 for indoor and outdoor bodies, respectively). When using the ADD, the R (2) decreased to 0.66 and 0.56. The developed decomposition scoring method is a practical method to measure decomposition for human remains found on land. The PMI can be estimated using this method, but caution is advised in cases with a long PMI. The ADD does not account for all the heat present in a decomposing remain and is therefore a possible bias.

The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis: Additional considerations,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is acquired as a systemic “trait” by individuals who are genetically susceptible. This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.",0,"The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis: Additional considerations Multiple sclerosis (MS) is acquired as a systemic “trait” by individuals who are genetically susceptible.

"The impact of sex, gender and pregnancy on 2009 H1N1 disease","Children and young adults of reproductive age have emerged as groups that are highly vulnerable to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The sex of an individual is a fundamental factor that can influence exposure, susceptibility and immune responses to influenza. Worldwide, the incidence, disease burden, morbidity and mortality rates following exposure to the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus differ between males and females and are often age-dependent. Pregnancy and differences in the presentation of various risk factors contribute to the worse outcome of infection in women. Vaccination and antiviral treatment efficacy also vary in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, sex-specific genetic and hormonal differences may contribute to the severity of influenza and the clearance of viral infection. The contribution of sex and gender to influenza can only be determined by a greater consideration of these factors in clinical and epidemiological studies and increased research into the biological basis underlying these differences.",0,"The impact of sex, gender and pregnancy on 2009 H1N1 disease Children and young adults of reproductive age have emerged as groups that are highly vulnerable to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Structural aspects of nucleotide ligand binding by a bacterial 2H phosphoesterase,"The 2H phosphoesterase family contains enzymes with two His-X-Ser/Thr motifs in the active site. 2H enzymes are found in all kingdoms of life, sharing little sequence identity despite the conserved overall fold and active site. For many 2H enzymes, the physiological function is unknown. Here, we studied the structure of the 2H family member LigT from Escherichia coli both in the apo form and complexed with different active-site ligands, including ATP, 2′-AMP, 3′-AMP, phosphate, and NADP(+). Comparisons to the well-characterized vertebrate myelin enzyme 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) highlight specific features of the catalytic cycle and substrate recognition in both enzymes. The role played by the helix α7, unique to CNPases within the 2H family, is apparently taken over by Arg130 in the bacterial enzyme. Other residues and loops lining the active site groove are likely to be important for RNA substrate binding. We visualized conformational changes related to ligand binding, as well as the position of the nucleophilic water molecule. We also present a low-resolution model of E. coli LigT bound to tRNA in solution, and provide a model for RNA binding by LigT, involving flexible loops lining the active site cavity. Taken together, our results both aid in understanding the common features of 2H family enzymes and help highlight the distinct features in the 2H family members, which must result in different reaction mechanisms. Unique aspects in different 2H family members can be observed in ligand recognition and binding, and in the coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule and the reactive phosphate moiety.",0,"Structural aspects of nucleotide ligand binding by a bacterial 2H phosphoesterase The 2H phosphoesterase family contains enzymes with two His-X-Ser/Thr motifs in the active site. 2H enzymes are found in all kingdoms of life, sharing little sequence identity despite the conserved overall fold and active site.

Common Genetic Polymorphisms within NFκB-Related Genes and the Risk of Developing Invasive Aspergillosis,"Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is an opportunistic infection caused by Aspergillus, a ubiquitously present airborne pathogenic mold. A growing number of studies suggest a major host genetic component in disease susceptibility. Here, we evaluated whether 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within NFκB1, NFκB2, RelA, RelB, Rel, and IRF4 genes influence the risk of IA in a population of 834 high-risk patients (157 IA and 677 non-IA) recruited through a collaborative effort involving the aspBIOmics consortium and four European clinical institutions. No significant overall associations between selected SNPs and the risk of IA were found in this large cohort. Although a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)-stratified analysis revealed that carriers of the IRF4(rs12203592T/T) genotype had a six-fold increased risk of developing the infection when compared with those carrying the C allele (OR(REC) = 6.24, 95%CI 1.25–31.2, P = 0.026), the association of this variant with IA risk did not reach significance at experiment-wide significant threshold. In addition, we found an association of the IRF4(AATC) and IRF4(GGTC) haplotypes (not including the IRF4(rs12203592T) risk allele) with a decreased risk of IA but the magnitude of the association was similar to the one observed in the single-SNP analysis, which indicated that the haplotypic effect on IA risk was likely due to the IRF4(rs12203592) SNP. Finally, no evidence of significant interactions among the genetic markers tested and the risk of IA was found. These results suggest that the SNPs on the studied genes do not have a clinically relevant impact on the risk of developing IA.",0,"Common Genetic Polymorphisms within NFκB-Related Genes and the Risk of Developing Invasive Aspergillosis Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is an opportunistic infection caused by Aspergillus, a ubiquitously present airborne pathogenic mold.

Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Among Intimate Partners During the Perinatal Period: A Narrative Literature Review,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects individuals and families from all backgrounds, regardless of their ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, or religion. Pregnancy and childbirth could be a time of vulnerability to violence because of changes in physical, emotional, social, and economic demands and needs. Prevalence of IPV against women during the perinatal period is increasingly researched and documented. However, evidence on IPV prevalence among intimate partners as well as on the course of IPV over the perinatal period is scarce. The purpose of this review was to provide a narrative synthesis of the existing literature regarding the prevalence estimates of IPV among intimate partners over the perinatal period. Through this review, we also gained better insight into associated factors, as well as the various forms of IPV. Of the 766 studies assessing prevalence estimates identified, 86 were included, where 80 studies focused on unidirectional IPV (i.e., perpetrated by men against women) and six studies investigated bidirectional IPV (i.e., IPV perpetrated by both partners). Most of the included studies reported lower overall prevalence rates for unidirectional IPV postpartum (range: 2–58%) compared to pregnancy (range: 1.5–66.9%). Psychological violence was found to be the most prevalent form of violence during the entire perinatal period. Studies on bidirectional IPV mostly reported women's perpetration to be almost as high as that of their partner or even higher, yet their findings need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, our results also highlighted the associated factors of IPV among partners, in which they were assimilated into a multi-level ecological model and were analyzed through an intersectional framework. Based on our findings, IPV is found to be highly prevalent during the entire perinatal period and in populations suffering from social inequalities. Further research exploring not only the occurrence, but also the motivations and the context of the bidirectionality of IPV during the perinatal period may facilitate better understanding of the detrimental consequences on partners and their families, as well as the development of effective intervention strategies.

Eye tracking is a tool used to monitor gaze patterns in medicine. The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of visual attention among critical care nurses performing non-simulated, routine patient care on invasively ventilated patients in an ICU. ICU nurses were tracked bedside in daily practice. Eight specific areas of interest were pre-defined (respirator, drug preparation, medication, patient data management system, patient, monitor, communication and equipment/perfusors). Main independent variable and primary outcome was dwell time, secondary outcomes were hit ratio, revisits, fixation count and average fixation time on areas of interest in a targeted tracking-time of 60 min. 28 ICU nurses were analyzed and the average tracking time was 65.5 min. Dwell time was significantly higher for the respirator (12.7% of total dwell time), patient data management system (23.7% of total dwell time) and patient (33.4% of total dwell time) compared to the other areas of interest. A similar distribution was observed for fixation count (respirator 13.3%, patient data management system 25.8% and patient 31.3%). Average fixation time and revisits of the respirator were markedly elevated. Apart from the respirator, average fixation time was highest for the patient data management system, communication and equipment/perfusors. Eye tracking is helpful to analyze the distribution of visual attention of critical care nurses. It demonstrates that the respirator, the patient data management system and the patient form cornerstones in the treatment of critically ill patients. This offers insights into complex work patterns in critical care and the possibility of improving work flows, avoiding human error and maximizing patient safety.

Evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a co-design approach to developing an integrated model of care for people with multi-morbid COPD in rural Nepal: a qualitative study,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the feasibility and acceptability of a co-design approach to developing an integrated model of healthcare for people with multi-morbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in rural Nepal. SETTINGS: A rural setting of Nepal. PARTICIPANTS: Data collection included five video recordings, five key informant interviews and observation notes from a final co-design workshop that involved a total of 68 stakeholders: persons with COPD and their family members; healthcare providers, including respiratory physicians; local community leaders; representatives from local, provincial and federal government; academics; and representatives from non-government organisations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Feasibility and acceptability of using a co-design approach to develop an integrated model of care for people with multi-morbid COPD in rural Nepal. RESULTS: Our qualitative evaluation of the Hasso Plattner’s co-design process found that all stakeholders (including people with COPD/community members, primary care practitioners and local government/senior health officials) were actively engaged in and significantly contributed to the process of co-design. Four main themes were identified which determined the feasibility and acceptability of the resulting integrated model of care: engagement of stakeholders, factors contributing to the co-design, consequences of the co-design process, and challenges and opportunities learnt by the researchers and participants in the co-design process. Based on the relationship between the four main themes emerging from this research, we developed an evaluation framework to guide the co-design of a health service innovation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the Hasso Plattner’s co-design process. Our findings suggest that this co-design approach can be useful and acceptable to local communities and government agencies. It enabled the meaningful contribution of a diverse group of stakeholders in the design and delivery of health services in low-income and middle-income countries.",0,"Evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a co-design approach to developing an integrated model of care for people with multi-morbid COPD in rural Nepal: a qualitative study OBJECTIVE: To understand the feasibility and acceptability of a co-design approach to developing an integrated model of healthcare for people with multi-morbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in rural Nepal.

The Impact of Model Building on the Transmission Dynamics under Vaccination: Observable (Symptom-Based) versus Unobservable (Contagiousness-Dependent) Approaches,"BACKGROUND: The way we formulate a mathematical model of an infectious disease to capture symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can greatly influence the likely effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of vaccine effect for preventing clinical illness. The present study aims to assess the impact of model building strategy on the epidemic threshold under vaccination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We consider two different types of mathematical models, one based on observable variables including symptom onset and recovery from clinical illness (hereafter, the “observable model”) and the other based on unobservable information of infection event and infectiousness (the “unobservable model”). By imposing a number of modifying assumptions to the observable model, we let it mimic the unobservable model, identifying that the two models are fully consistent only when the incubation period is identical to the latent period and when there is no pre-symptomatic transmission. We also computed the reproduction numbers with and without vaccination, demonstrating that the data generating process of vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness is consistent with the observable model only and examining how the effective reproduction number is differently calculated by two models. CONCLUSIONS: To explicitly incorporate the vaccine effect in reducing the risk of symptomatic illness into the model, it is fruitful to employ a model that directly accounts for disease progression. More modeling studies based on observable epidemiological information are called for.",0,"The Impact of Model Building on the Transmission Dynamics under Vaccination: Observable (Symptom-Based) versus Unobservable (Contagiousness-Dependent) Approaches BACKGROUND: The way we formulate a mathematical model of an infectious disease to capture symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can greatly influence the likely effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of vaccine effect for preventing clinical illness.

Interaction of the HIV-1 frameshift signal with the ribosome,"Ribosomal frameshifting on viral RNAs relies on the mechanical properties of structural elements, often pseudoknots and more rarely stem-loops, that are unfolded by the ribosome during translation. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 type B a long hairpin containing a three-nucleotide bulge is responsible for efficient frameshifting. This three-nucleotide bulge separates the hairpin in two domains: an unstable lower stem followed by a GC-rich upper stem. Toeprinting and chemical probing assays suggest that a hairpin-like structure is retained when ribosomes, initially bound at the slippery sequence, were allowed multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles. However, while the upper stem remains intact the lower stem readily melts. After the first, and single step of translocation of deacylated tRNA to the 30 S P site, movement of the mRNA stem-loop in the 5′ direction is halted, which is consistent with the notion that the downstream secondary structure resists unfolding. Mechanical stretching of the hairpin using optical tweezers only allows clear identification of unfolding of the upper stem at a force of 12.8 ± 1.0 pN. This suggests that the lower stem is unstable and may indeed readily unfold in the presence of a translocating ribosome.",0,"Interaction of the HIV-1 frameshift signal with the ribosome Ribosomal frameshifting on viral RNAs relies on the mechanical properties of structural elements, often pseudoknots and more rarely stem-loops, that are unfolded by the ribosome during translation.

Activity of sputum p38 MAPK is correlated with airway inflammation and reduced FEV(1) in COPD patients,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants of the progression and severity of COPD. The present study explored the correlation between sputum p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MATERIAL/METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from 48 COPD patients and 12 healthy persons. Sputum p38 MAPK activity was measured by Western blotting and sputum levels of CXCL8 and neutrophil, and lung function was measured. The correlation between p38MAPK activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function was analyzed. RESULT: Our results showed the significantly increased expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and CXCL8 in the sputum samples of the COPD patients. The p38 MAPK activity was remarkably correlated with the CXCL8 level and neutrophils infiltration in the airway, and the decline of lung function in the COPD patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the pivotal role of p38 MAPK in the airway inflammation of COPD patients.

Mechanisms and biomedical implications of –1 programmed ribosome frameshifting on viral and bacterial mRNAs,"Some proteins are expressed as a result of a ribosome frameshifting event that is facilitated by a slippery site and downstream secondary structure elements in the mRNA. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding mechanisms of –1 frameshifting in several viral genes, including IBV 1a/1b, HIV‐1 gag‐pol, and SFV 6K, and in Escherichia coli dnaX. The exact frameshifting route depends on the availability of aminoacyl‐tRNAs: the ribosome normally slips into the –1‐frame during tRNA translocation, but can also frameshift during decoding at condition when aminoacyl‐tRNA is in limited supply. Different frameshifting routes and additional slippery sites allow viruses to maintain a constant production of their key proteins. The emerging idea that tRNA pools are important for frameshifting provides new direction for developing antiviral therapies.",0,"Mechanisms and biomedical implications of –1 programmed ribosome frameshifting on viral and bacterial mRNAs Some proteins are expressed as a result of a ribosome frameshifting event that is facilitated by a slippery site and downstream secondary structure elements in the mRNA.

Modern Approaches in Probiotics Research to Control Foodborne Pathogens,"Foodborne illness is a serious public health concern. There are over 200 known microbial, chemical, and physical agents that are known to cause foodborne illness. Efforts are made for improved detection, control and prevention of foodborne pathogen in food, and pathogen associated diseases in the host. Several commonly used approaches to control foodborne pathogens include antibiotics, natural antimicrobials, bacteriophages, bacteriocins, ionizing radiations, and heat. In addition, probiotics offer a potential intervention strategy for the prevention and control of foodborne infections. This review focuses on the use of probiotics and bioengineered probiotics to control foodborne pathogens, their antimicrobial actions, and their delivery strategies.

A Highly Efficient and Simple Construction Strategy for Producing Recombinant Baculovirus Bombyx mori Nucleopolyhedrovirus,"The silkworm baculovirus expression system is widely used to produce recombinant proteins. Several strategies for constructing recombinant viruses that contain foreign genes have been reported. Here, we developed a novel defective-rescue BmNPV Bacmid (reBmBac) expression system. A CopyControl origin of replication was introduced into the viral genome to facilitate its genetic manipulation in Escherichia coli and to ensure the preparation of large amounts of high quality reBmBac DNA as well as high quality recombinant baculoviruses. The ORF1629, cathepsin and chitinase genes were partially deleted or rendered defective to improve the efficiency of recombinant baculovirus generation and the expression of foreign genes. The system was validated by the successful expression of luciferase reporter gene and porcine interferon γ. This system can be used to produce batches of recombinant baculoviruses and target proteins rapidly and efficiently in silkworms.",0,"A Highly Efficient and Simple Construction Strategy for Producing Recombinant Baculovirus Bombyx mori Nucleopolyhedrovirus The silkworm baculovirus expression system is widely used to produce recombinant proteins.

"No implant, no solution, lost cases to surgery: orthopedic trauma triage for surgery in an NGO hospital in Sierra Leone","INTRODUCTION: In low-income countries (LIC), international surgeons face the fact that there are patients they cannot treat. The goal of this study was to identify and analyze patients lost to treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the data of 282 trauma victims from a non-governmental organizational (NGO) hospital in Sierra Leone, Africa. During a 3-month period (10.10.2015–08.01.2016), these patients had 367 injuries and underwent 263 orthopedic surgeries. Despite a clear indication, some patients did not receive surgical treatment. We identified these injuries and the reason why they could not be operated. The anatomic region of the injury was evaluated and if they had a bone or soft tissue defect or were infected. RESULTS: We identified 95 (25.89%) injuries in 70 patients (47 males; 23 females) that were not be operated. The reasons were lack of specific implants (no implant group; N = 33), no treatment strategy for the injury (no solution group; N = 29), and patients that were lost (lost patient group; N = 33), almost equally distributed by 1/3. In the no implant group were mainly closed fractures and fractures of the pelvis and the proximal femur. The implants needed were locking plates (N = 19), proximal femoral nails (N = 8), and implants for pelvic surgery (N = 6). In the no solution group were nearly all bone (P < 0.0000), soft tissue defects (P < 0.00001) and infections (P = 0.00003) compared to the rest and more open fractures (P < 0.00001). In the lost patients group, most fractures were closed (24 out of 33, P = 0.033). These fractures were mostly not urgent and were postponed repeatedly. CONCLUSION: One quarter of the patients did not receive the surgical treatment needed. Besides acquisition of implants, surgical skills and expertise could be a solution for this issue.

Outbreak of KPC-2 Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST76 and Carbapenem-resistant K2 Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae ST375 strains in Northeast China: molecular and virulent characteristics,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have recently come into existence worldwide; however, researchers in northeast China are not aware of their clinical features and molecular characteristics. METHODS: Here, the molecular and virulent characteristics of 44 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates collected from January 2015 to December 2017 were studied. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were carried out to define the clonal relatedness among the isolates. PCR and capsular serotyping of the virulence-associated genes, as well as biofilm formation and serum complement-mediated killing assays, were employed to determine the virulent potential. The genomic features and associated mobile genetic elements of JmsCRE57 were detected by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: The only positive isolate was JmsCRE57, which belonged to the ST375 serotype K2 that expressed uge, mrkD, fimH, kpn, aerobactin and rmpA virulence-associated genes and showed strong biofilm formation and serum sensitivity. Sequencing results showed that the JmsCRE57 genome mainly consisted of a circular chromosome, three antimicrobial resistant plasmids and a virulent plasmid. The antimicrobial resistant plasmid expressing bla(KPC-2), bla(CTX-M-15), aph(3″)-Ib, aph(6)-Id, qnrB1, aac(3)-IIa, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, bla(OXA-1), bla(TEM-1B), catB4, sul2, dfrA14 and bla(SHV-99). The virulent plasmid belonged to the IncHI1B group, which is mainly composed of mucoid phenotype genes and siderophore-associated genes. The remaining CRKP strains that expressed uge, fimH, mrkD and kpn virulence-associated genes were not successfully typed. CONCLUSION: Our results provide new insights on the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant K2 hypervirulent K. pneumoniae ST375 and CRKP ST76 strains in northeast China, which may help control their future outbreaks.",0,"Outbreak of KPC-2 Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST76 and Carbapenem-resistant K2 Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae ST375 strains in Northeast China: molecular and virulent characteristics BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have recently come into existence worldwide; however, researchers in northeast China are not aware of their clinical features and molecular characteristics.

Existing health inequalities in India: informing preparedness planning for an influenza pandemic,"On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the world was in phase 6 of an influenza pandemic. In India, the first case of 2009 H1N1 influenza was reported on 16 May 2009 and by August 2010 (when the pandemic was declared over), 38 730 cases of 2009 H1N1 had been confirmed of which there were 2024 deaths. Here, we propose a conceptual model of the sources of health disparities in an influenza pandemic in India. Guided by a published model of the plausible sources of such disparities in the United States, we reviewed the literature for the determinants of the plausible sources of health disparities during a pandemic in India. We find that factors at multiple social levels could determine inequalities in the risk of exposure and susceptibility to influenza, as well as access to treatment once infected: (1) religion, caste and indigenous identity, as well as education and gender at the individual level; (2) wealth at the household level; and (3) the type of location, ratio of health care practitioners to population served, access to transportation and public spending on health care in the geographic area of residence. Such inequalities could lead to unequal levels of disease and death. Whereas causal factors can only be determined by testing the model when incidence and mortality data, collected in conjunction with socio-economic and geographic factors, become available, we put forth recommendations that policy makers can undertake to ensure that the pandemic preparedness plan includes a focus on social inequalities in India in order to prevent their exacerbation in a pandemic.",0,"Existing health inequalities in India: informing preparedness planning for an influenza pandemic On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the world was in phase 6 of an influenza pandemic.

Evaluation of diaphragm ultrasound in predicting extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated patients with COPD,"BACKGROUND: To explore the value of the right hemi-diaphragmatic excursion (DE) and its variation in predicting extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated patients with COPD. METHODS: All included patients with COPD received mechanical ventilation (MV) and were ready to wean from MV. After patients passed the 30 min spontaneous breathing trail (SBT), extubation was considered to be feasible, and the right DE measured by ultrasound at 0 min, 5 min, and 30 min of SBT were named as DE(0), DE(5), and DE(30), respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients succeeded extubation; 12 patients failed. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC(ROC)) of DE(30) and ΔDE(30−5) (the variation between 30 and 5 min) were 0.762 and 0.835; a cutoff value of DE(30) > 1.72 cm and ΔDE(30−5) > 0.16 cm were associated with a successful extubation with a sensitivity of 76% and 84%, a specificity of 75% and 83.3%, respectively. The predictive probability equation of the DE(30) plus ∆DE(30−5) was P = 1/[1 + e(−(−5.625+17.689×∆DE)(30−5)(+1.802×DE)(30)())], a cutoff value of P > 0.626 was associated with a successful extubation with the AUC(ROC) of 0.867, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 83.3%.

Resveratrol attenuates cortical neuron activity: roles of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and voltage-gated sodium channels,"BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and red wine, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities. However, relatively little is known about whether resveratrol modulates the ion channels in cortical neurons. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)) and voltage-gated sodium channels were expressed in cortical neurons and play important roles in regulation of neuronal excitability. The present study aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on BK(Ca) currents and voltage-gated sodium currents in cortical neurons. RESULTS: Resveratrol concentration-dependently increased the current amplitude and the opening activity of BK(Ca) channels, but suppressed the amplitude of voltage-gated sodium currents. Similar to the BK(Ca) channel opener NS1619, resveratrol decreased the firing rate of action potentials. In addition, the enhancing effects of BK(Ca) channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and paxilline on action potential firing were sensitive to resveratrol. Our results indicated that the attenuation of action potential firing rate by resveratrol might be mediated through opening the BK(Ca) channels and closing the voltage-gated sodium channels. CONCLUSIONS: As BK(Ca) channels and sodium channels are critical molecular determinants for seizure generation, our findings suggest that regulation of these two channels in cortical neurons probably makes a considerable contribution to the antiseizure activity of resveratrol.",0,"Resveratrol attenuates cortical neuron activity: roles of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and voltage-gated sodium channels BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and red wine, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities.

"Disentangling the Impacts of Speciation, Sympatry and the Island Effect on the Morphology of Seven Hynobius sp. Salamanders","SIMPLE SUMMARY: Morphological changes are common in populations of animals in response to environmental and evolutionary forces. This is the case for salamanders, which can adapt to most environments on earth. On the Korean Peninsula, Hynobius salamanders are widespread, with several species overlapping in distribution. In addition, while there are seven segregated clades based on mitochondrial DNA, only four of them have been described as segregated species and the three others are candidate species for which the species level of divergence has not been tested yet. Here we measured 329 individuals from all seven clades, in areas of range overlap or not, on islands and on the mainland (Graphical Abstract A), and tested for the species status of the three candidate species. Individuals on the mainland had a generally broader morphology than those on the islands (Graphical Abstract B), and individuals in the range overlap differed from the individuals from the same species that were not found in presence of another clade (Graphical Abstract C). Despite a significant impact of the island effect and the sympatric areas, all seven clades have significantly different morphologies, and we describe Hynobius notialis sp. nov., Hynobius geojeensis sp. nov. and Hynobius perplicatus sp. nov. ABSTRACT: Closely related individuals from different areas can see their morphologies change based on differences between clades, but also ecological variables such as the island effect or sympatry. This is the case of salamanders, which have adapted to a broad range of ecological niches, ranging from underground dwellers in xeric landscape to tropical arboreal habitats. On the Korean Peninsula, salamanders from the Hynobius clade are widespread on the mainland and islands, with several partially sympatric clades and candidate species. Currently, seven lineages have been identified based on mtDNA, four of them matching named species and three others for which the species status remains untested. While the morphology of Korean Hynobius is known to be variable between genetically segregated clades, we hypothesise that (1) the candidate species are morphologically different, and that (2) the island effect and (3) the sympatric status have significant impacts on the morphology of individuals within the genus. Here we measured 329 Hynobius salamanders from all seven clades, in areas of sympatry and allopatry, and on islands and on the mainland (Graphical Abstract A). We determined that the island effect had a significant impact on the morphology of the genus, with mainland individuals generally displaying a broader range of morphology than islandic individuals (Graphical Abstract B). We also determined that sympatry had an impact on morphology, with the sizes of individuals from clades in sympatric areas diverging from each other (Graphical Abstract C). Finally, we demonstrated that all seven clades have significantly different morphologies, and we described the three candidate species that had already been isolated based on mtDNA and microsatellite data: Hynobius notialis sp. nov., Hynobius geojeensis sp. nov. and Hynobius perplicatus sp. nov. We conclude that looking at morphology alone would be misleading about the true diversity of Hynobius species, and species in general, because of the island and patry effects.",0,"Disentangling the Impacts of Speciation, Sympatry and the Island Effect on the Morphology of Seven Hynobius sp.

"Cycloastragenol upregulates SIRT1 expression, attenuates apoptosis and suppresses neuroinflammation after brain ischemia","Cycloastragenol (CAG) is the active form of astragaloside IV isolated from Astragalus Radix, which displays multiple pharmacological effects. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase, has been shown to play an important role in neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether CAG protected against ischemic brain injury and, if so, whether the beneficial effects were associated with the regulation of SIRT1 in the ischemic brain. Mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. CAG (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion, 12 h later and then twice daily for up to three days. CAG dose-dependently reduced brain infarct volume, significantly ameliorated functional deficits, and prevented neuronal cell loss in MCAO mice. Meanwhile, CAG significantly reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, prevented tight junction degradation and subsequently ameliorated blood-brain barrier disruption. Moreover, CAG significantly upregulated SIRT1 expression in the ischemic brain but did not directly activate its enzymatic activity. Concomitant with SIRT1 upregulation, CAG reduced p53 acetylation and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in the ischemic brain. CAG also inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. As a result, CAG suppressed the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, and inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the ischemic brain. Our findings suggest that CAG is neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury in mice and that its beneficial effect may involve SIRT1 upregulation and the inhibition of apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain.",0,"Cycloastragenol upregulates SIRT1 expression, attenuates apoptosis and suppresses neuroinflammation after brain ischemia Cycloastragenol (CAG) is the active form of astragaloside IV isolated from Astragalus Radix, which displays multiple pharmacological effects.

The role of the microbiome in ovarian cancer: mechanistic insights into oncobiosis and to bacterial metabolite signaling,"Ovarian cancer is characterized by dysbiosis, referred to as oncobiosis in neoplastic diseases. In ovarian cancer, oncobiosis was identified in numerous compartments, including the tumor tissue itself, the upper and lower female genital tract, serum, peritoneum, and the intestines. Colonization was linked to Gram-negative bacteria with high inflammatory potential. Local inflammation probably participates in the initiation and continuation of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, local bacterial colonies in the peritoneum may facilitate metastasis formation in ovarian cancer. Vaginal infections (e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis) increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Bacterial metabolites, produced by the healthy eubiome or the oncobiome, may exert autocrine, paracrine, and hormone-like effects, as was evidenced in breast cancer or pancreas adenocarcinoma. We discuss the possible involvement of lipopolysaccharides, lysophosphatides and tryptophan metabolites, as well as, short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and polyamines in the carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer. We discuss the applicability of nutrients, antibiotics, and probiotics to harness the microbiome and support ovarian cancer therapy. The oncobiome and the most likely bacterial metabolites play vital roles in mediating the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Finally, we discuss the potential of oncobiotic changes as biomarkers for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer and microbial metabolites as possible adjuvant agents in therapy.",0,"The role of the microbiome in ovarian cancer: mechanistic insights into oncobiosis and to bacterial metabolite signaling Ovarian cancer is characterized by dysbiosis, referred to as oncobiosis in neoplastic diseases.

The role of Immunity in Fabry Disease and Hypertension: A Review of a Novel Common Pathway,"Fabry disease is a progressive, X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder where accumulation of glycosphingolipids increases the risk for early cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, stroke, and end stage renal disease. Besides disease-specific therapy, blood pressure (BP) control is of central importance in Fabry disease to reduce disease progression and improve prognosis. Both Fabry disease and hypertension are characterized by the activation of the innate component of the immune system, with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a common trigger to the inflammatory cascade. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in the establishment of low-grade chronic inflammation and redox unbalance that contribute to organ damage in the long term. Besides exploiting the anti-inflammatory effects of RAS blockade and enzyme replacement therapy, targeted therapies acting on the immune system represent an appealing field of research in these conditions. The aim of this narrative review is to examine the issue of hypertension in the setting of Fabry disease, focusing on the possible determinants of their reciprocal relationship, as well as on the related clinical and therapeutic implications.",0,"The role of Immunity in Fabry Disease and Hypertension: A Review of a Novel Common Pathway Fabry disease is a progressive, X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder where accumulation of glycosphingolipids increases the risk for early cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, stroke, and end stage renal disease.

TRIAL DESIGN: The study is designed as a multi-center, interventional, parallel-group, randomized (1:1 ratio), investigator-sponsored, two-arm study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and inpatients will be recruited from 8 Japanese academic and non-academic hospitals. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria 1. Diagnosed as positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 2. Clinical stages of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. 3. Symptomatic; 4. ≥ 20 years of age. 5. Male or female. 6. Ability to communicate in Japanese. 7. Outpatients and inpatients. 8. Provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria 1. Difficulty in providing informed consent due to dementia, psychosis, or psychiatric symptoms. 2. Allergic to Kampo or Western medicines used in this study. 3. Pregnant and lactating. 4. Unable to follow up. 5. Participating in another clinical trial or interventional study. 6. Hypokalemic or taking oral furosemide or steroids. 7. Determined unsuitable for this study by the physician. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the control group will receive conventional treatment with antipyretics, painkillers, or antitussives for symptoms that occurred after they contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients in the Kampo group will receive 2.5 g of KT (TJ-1@TSUMURA and Co.) and 2.5 g of SSKKS (TJ-109@TSUMURA and Co.) 3 times a day, orally, for 14 days in addition to the conventional treatment as mentioned above. MAIN OUTCOMES: The number of days till at least one of the symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, malaise, shortness of breath) improves in the first 14 days of treatment. To assess the cough, sputum, malaise, and shortness of breath, a numeric rating scale will be used to define improvement in terms of a 2-point decrease in the number of days from the start of treatment for at least 2 days. Fever will be defined as an improvement when the temperature is less than 37 °C. RANDOMIZATION: Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group using the minimization method, with balancing of the arms with severity of disease stage and patient age (< 65, 65 to < 75, or ≥ 75 years). Computer-generated random numbers will be used for the minimization method. BLINDING (MASKING): Open-label with no blinding NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The main research hypothesis of this study is that the combination of Kampo medicine and conventional treatment will significantly improve the patients’ symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, sputum, and shortness of breath) during the first 14 days of treatment as compared with conventional treatment alone. Concerning the analysis of the primary endpoint, the duration of time before improvement of at least one of the common cold-like symptoms (fever, malaise, cough, sputum, and shortness of breath) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the survival curves will be compared between groups using the log-rank test. Assuming this method of analysis and based on previous studies reporting the efficacy of Kampo medicine for COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza patients, the median survival time in the Kampo medicine group is estimated as 3 days; this time will be 1.5 times longer in the control group. Assuming a one-sided significance level of 5%, a power of 70%, and an allocation ratio of 1:1, the required sample size is calculated as 126 cases.

The Battle Between Influenza and the Innate Immune Response in the Human Respiratory Tract,"Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory tract. Infection is normally confined to the upper respiratory tract but certain viral strains have evolved the ability to infect the lower respiratory tract, including the alveoli, leading to inflammation and a disease pattern of diffuse alveolar damage. Factors leading to this sequence of events are novel influenza strains, or strains that have viral proteins, in particular the NS1 protein that allow it to escape the innate immune system. There are three main barriers that prevent infection of pneumocytes - mucin, host defence lectins and cells such as macrophages. Viruses have developed strategies such as neuraminidase and glycosylation patterns that allow this evasion. Though there has been much investment in antiviral drugs, it is proposed that more attention should be directed towards developing or utilizing compounds that enhance the ability of the innate immune system to combat viral infection.",0,"The Battle Between Influenza and the Innate Immune Response in the Human Respiratory Tract Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory tract.

Interacting opinion and disease dynamics in multiplex networks: Discontinuous phase transition and nonmonotonic consensus times,"Opinion formation and disease spreading are among the most studied dynamical processes on complex networks. In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction [Formula: see text] of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling [Formula: see text] overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with [Formula: see text] in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.",0,"Interacting opinion and disease dynamics in multiplex networks: Discontinuous phase transition and nonmonotonic consensus times Opinion formation and disease spreading are among the most studied dynamical processes on complex networks.

Problems and prospects of developing effective therapy for common cold viruses,"No effective treatment for common colds has yet been developed. Combination antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies are the best hope for intervention after the onset of symptoms.

Immunocytochemical Localization of the Menkes Copper Transport Protein (ATP7A) to the Trans-Golgi Network,"We have generated polyclonal antibodies against the amino-terminal third of the Menkes protein (ATP7A; MNK) by immunizing rabbits with a histidine-tagged MNK fusion construct containing metal-binding domains 1–4. The purified antibodies were used in Western analysis of cell lysates and in indirect immunofluorescence experiments on cultured cells. On Western blots, the antibodies recognized the ∼165 kDa MNK protein in CHO cells and human fibroblasts. No MNK signal could be detected in fibroblasts from a patient with Menkes disease or in Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells, confirming the specificity of the antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis of CHO cells and human fibroblasts showed a distinct perinuclear signal corresponding to the pattern of the Golgi complex. This staining pattern was similar to that of α-mannosidase II which is a known resident enzyme of the Golgi complex. Using brefeldin A, a fungal inhibitor of protein secretion, we further demonstrated that the MNK protein is localized to the trans-Golgi network. This data provides direct evidence for a subcellular localization of the MNK protein which is similar to the proposed vacuolar localization of Ccc2p, the yeast homolog of MNK and WND (ATP7B), the Wilson disease gene product. In light of the proposed role of MNK both in subcellular copper trafficking and in copper efflux, these data suggest a model for how these two processes are linked and represent an important step in the functional analysis of the MNK protein.",0,"Immunocytochemical Localization of the Menkes Copper Transport Protein (ATP7A) to the Trans-Golgi Network We have generated polyclonal antibodies against the amino-terminal third of the Menkes protein (ATP7A; MNK) by immunizing rabbits with a histidine-tagged MNK fusion construct containing metal-binding domains 1–4.

Strongyloides stercoralis Hyper infection Syndrome,"Strongyloides stercoralis is a helminth, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical countries. Its infestation in humans usually does not produce symptoms. However, in some patients, severe and life-threatening forms of this infection can occur, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Severe parasitic infection is triggered by any imbalance in the host’s immunity favouring the auto-infective cycle. This results in an increase in the intraluminal parasitic burden. In addition, tissue infestation is also very common. Clinical presentation is variable, and it is very difficult to diagnose clinically. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. In some cases, the diagnosis is established only on histopathological examination of the excised tissue by the pathologist. Here, the authors report a case of an elderly male diabetic patient, who presented to the emergency department with the features of acute abdomen. On exploratory laparotomy, he was found to have the features suggestive of gangrene of small bowel. Resection of the gangrenous bowel was done, and end-to-end anastomosis was done as the rest of the bowel appeared to be normal. However, the patient died of multi-organ failure and septicaemia on the second postoperative day. The resected intestine showed tissue infestation of Strongyloides stercoralis on histopathological examination. In this review article, the authors summarize a case of hyper infection syndrome of strongyloidiasis and discuss the various aspects of Strongyloides stercoralis infection with emphasis on life cycle of the parasite and different clinical features of the disease.",0,"Strongyloides stercoralis Hyper infection Syndrome Strongyloides stercoralis is a helminth, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical countries.

Simple Semantics in Topic Detection and Tracking,"Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a research initiative that aims at techniques to organize news documents in terms of news events. We propose a method that incorporates simple semantics into TDT by splitting the term space into groups of terms that have the meaning of the same type. Such a group can be associated with an external ontology. This ontology is used to determine the similarity of two terms in the given group. We extract proper names, locations, temporal expressions and normal terms into distinct sub-vectors of the document representation. Measuring the similarity of two documents is conducted by comparing a pair of their corresponding sub-vectors at a time. We use a simple perceptron to optimize the relative emphasis of each semantic class in the tracking and detection decisions. The results suggest that the spatial and the temporal similarity measures need to be improved. Especially the vagueness of spatial and temporal terms needs to be addressed.",0,"Simple Semantics in Topic Detection and Tracking Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a research initiative that aims at techniques to organize news documents in terms of news events.

Structure and Function of the Hef Glycoprotein of Influenza C Virus,"Soon after the first isolation of an influenza C virus from a patient, it became obvious that this virus differs from other myxoviruses in several aspects. Pronounced differences have been observed in the interactions between the virus and cell surfaces, suggesting that influenza C virus attaches to the receptors different from those recognized by other myxoviruses. While influenza A and B viruses agglutinate erythrocytes from many species, including humans, the spectrum of erythrocytes agglutinated by influenza C virus is much more restricted. Erythrocytes from rats, mice, and adult chickens are suitable for hemagglutination and hemadsorption tests; cells from other species, however, react not at all or only poorly with influenza C virus. Differences are also observed so far as hemagglutination inhibitors are concerned. A variety of glycoproteins have been shown to prevent influenza A and B viruses from agglutinating erythrocytes. In the case of influenza C virus, rat serum was for a long time the only known hemagglutination inhibitor. A difference in the receptors for influenza C virus and other myxo-viruses was also suggested by studies on the receptor-destroying enzyme. The ability of influenza C virus to inactivate its own receptors was reported soon after the first isolation of this virus from a patient. However, the influenza C enzyme did not affect the receptors of other myxoviruses and, conversely, the receptor-destroying enzyme of either of the latter viruses was unable to inactivate the receptors for influenza C virus on erythrocytes. While the enzyme of influenza A and B virus was characterized as a neuraminidase in the 1950s, even with refined methodology no such activity was detectable with influenza C virus. It is now known that both the receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities, as well as the fusion activity of influenza C virus are mediated by the only glycoprotein present on the surface of the virus particle. The structure and functions of this protein, which is designated as HEF, are reviewed in this chapter.",0,"Structure and Function of the Hef Glycoprotein of Influenza C Virus Soon after the first isolation of an influenza C virus from a patient, it became obvious that this virus differs from other myxoviruses in several aspects.

Effect of pH on the growth and cytopathogenicity of avian infectious bronchitis virus in chick kidney cells,"The growth of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chick kidney cells at different pH values in the range 6.0–9.0 demonstrated that although the virus was released at a much faster rate at the higher pH values the titre tended to drop more quickly. At the acid pH values the virus was released more slowly but reached a maximum titre similar to that at the higher pH values and showed only minimum reduction in infectivity up to 49 hours post inoculation. The stability of virus in tissue culture medium was shown to be directly related to pH between pH 6.0–8.0, being more stable at the acid pH values. The degree of cytopathogenicity induced in chick kidney cells following infection with IBV was directly related to the pH at which the cells were incubated, occurring earlier and more extensively in cells at the higher pH values. Cell macromolecule synthesis in chick kidney cells was inhibited following infection with IBV and was apparently due to cell damage and death.",0,"Effect of pH on the growth and cytopathogenicity of avian infectious bronchitis virus in chick kidney cells The growth of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chick kidney cells at different pH values in the range 6.0–9.0 demonstrated that although the virus was released at a much faster rate at the higher pH values the titre tended to drop more quickly.

The stability of virus in tissue culture medium was shown to be directly related to pH between pH 6.0–8.0, being more stable at the acid pH values. The degree of cytopathogenicity induced in chick kidney cells following infection with IBV was directly related to the pH at which the cells were incubated, occurring earlier and more extensively in cells at the higher pH values.

Efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicines for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease that may progress into, in the absence of proper treatment, severe liver damage. While the optimal pharmacotherapy for NAFLD remains uncertain and the adherence to lifestyle interventions is challenging, the use of herbal medicines such as traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) to manage the condition is common. The evidence about TCMs in the management of NAFLD is continuously developing through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This study aims to identify and evaluate the emerging evidence about the efficacy and safety of TCMs for NAFLD. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify RCTs which investigated TCMs in the management of NAFLD published in 6 electronic databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and China National Knowledge Infrastructure since inception to September 2020. RCTs comparing TCMs with no treatment, placebo, non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological interventions were included irrespective of language or blinding. The quality of reporting was evaluated using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement extensions for Chinese herbal medicine Formulas (CONSORT-CHM). Risk-of-bias for each study was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of 53 RCTs involving 5997 participants with NAFLD were included in this review. Each included RCT tested a different TCMs giving a total of 53 TCMs identified in this study. Based on the evaluation of the RCT results, TCMs might have various beneficial effects such as improving TCM syndrome score, liver function, and body lipid profile. A range of non-serious, reversible adverse effects associated with the use of TCMs were also reported. However, no conclusion about the efficacy and safety of TCMs in NAFLD can be made. The quality of reporting was generally poor and the risks of bias was mostly uncertain in all trials. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence from RCTs that supported the effectiveness and safety of TCMs for NAFLD. However, no conclusive recommendations can be made due to the questionable quality of the RCTs. Improvement in the RCT protocol, the use of a larger sample size, a setting of multicenter, and a more focused approach in selecting TCMs are recommended for developing high quality evidence about the use of TCMs in managing NAFLD.",0,"Efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicines for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease that may progress into, in the absence of proper treatment, severe liver damage.

GenomeLandscaper: Landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps assessing chromosome architecture,"Assessing correctness of an assembled chromosome architecture is a central challenge. We create a geometric analysis method (called GenomeLandscaper) to conduct landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps (GFM), trace large-scale repetitive regions, and assess their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes. We develop an alignment-free method for phylogenetics analysis. The human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY) are analysed as a proof-of-concept study. We construct a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM) for them, and a landscape compatibility among relatives is observed. But a long sharp straight line on the GGFM breaks such a landscape compatibility, distinguishing GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p7.chrY) from GRCh37p13.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY. We delete a 1.30-Mbp target segment to rescue the landscape compatibility, matching the antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY. We re-locate it into the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY, matching a gap placeholder of GRCh37p13.chrY. We decompose it into sub-constituents (such as BACs, interspersed repeats, and tandem repeats) and trace their homologues by phylogenetics analysis. We elucidate that most examined tandem repeats are of reasonable quality, but the BAC-sized repeats, 173U1020C (176.46 Kbp) and 5U41068C (205.34 Kbp), are likely over-repeated. These results offer unique insights into the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of the human Y chromosomes.",0,"GenomeLandscaper: Landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps assessing chromosome architecture Assessing correctness of an assembled chromosome architecture is a central challenge.

Optimization of surgical timing of congenital diaphragmatic hernia using the quantified flow patterns of patent ductus arteriosus,"PURPOSE: The optimal timing of surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is controversial. We aimed to validate our protocol for the timing of CDH repair using the quantified patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) flow pattern. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study analyzed patients with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated CDH between 2007 and 2020. We defined the “LR ratio” as the percentage of velocity–time integral (VTI) of the left-to-right flow of PDA against overall VTI on echocardiography. Since 2010, we followed the decision criterion of performing surgery when LR ratio of > 50% has been achieved in the patients (protocol group). The protocol group (2010–2020) was compared with the historical control group (2007–2009). RESULTS: The average age at surgery was 104.1 ± 175.9 and 37.3 ± 30.6 h in the control and protocol groups, respectively (p = 0.11). Survival rate (88.9% vs. 95.0%, p = 0.53) and the rate of worsening of pulmonary hypertension within 24 h after surgery (22.2% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.57) were not different between the groups. The protocol group had a significantly shorter duration of tracheal intubation (26.9 ± 21.1 vs. 13.3 ± 9.5 days, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our decision criterion might have the advantage of facilitating early and safe surgery for patients with CDH.",0,"Optimization of surgical timing of congenital diaphragmatic hernia using the quantified flow patterns of patent ductus arteriosus PURPOSE: The optimal timing of surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is controversial.

Recent innovations of ultrasound green technology in herbal phytochemistry: A review,"Ultrasound (US) has become one of the most important techniques in green chemistry and emerging technologies. Many research investigations documented the usefulness of US in a wide range of applications in food science, nanotechnology, and complementary medicine, where effective extraction of natural products is important. However, as with all novel technologies, US has advantages and limitations that require clarification for full adaptation at an industrial scale. The present review discusses recent applications of US in herbal phytochemistry with the emphasis on US effects on chemical structures of bioactive compounds extracted from herbs and their bioactivities. The impact of different US processing conditions such as frequency, intensity, duration, temperature, and pressure on the effectiveness of the extraction process and the properties of the extracted materials are also discussed. Different frequencies and intensities of US have demonstrated its potential applications in modifying, determining, and predicting the physicochemical properties of herbs and their extracts. US has important applications in nanotechnology where it supports the fabrication of inexpensive and eco-friendly herbal nanostructures, as well as acoustic-based biosensors for chemical imaging of the herbal tissues. The application of US enhances the rates of chemical processes such as hydrolysis of herbal fibers, which reduces the time and energy consumed without affecting the quality of the final products.

The novel quinolizidine derivate IMB-HDC inhibits STAT5a phosphorylation at 694 and 780 and promotes DNA breakage and cell apoptosis via blocking STAT5a nuclear translocation,"Sophoridine is a quinolizidine natural product and the exploration of its derivatives has been carried out, and the potent anticancer compound IMB-HDC was acquired. Although previous studies have revealed that some sophoridine derivatives could induce DNA breakage, the underlying mechanisms of inhibition of DNA damage repair (ATR inactivation) and the apoptosis independent of p53, have not been elucidated. Our research reveals a novel DNA response mechanism different from general DNA-damaging agents, and that sophoridine derivate inhibits the phosphorylation of Tyr694 and Ser780 of STAT5a to induce the lessened shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and leads to the decreased nuclear STAT5a and subsequently inhibits the expression of STAT5a target gene RAD51 that contributes to the checkpoint activation, thus inhibiting ATR activation. Meanwhile, IMB-HDC that induced the diminished expression of STAT5a target gene contributes to proliferation and leads to apoptosis. More importantly, we give the first evidence that promoting the effect of Tyr694 phosphorylation on nuclear location and subsequent STAT5a target gene transcription depends on Ser780 increased or unchanged phosphorylation and was not correlated with Ser726 phosphorylation.",0,"The novel quinolizidine derivate IMB-HDC inhibits STAT5a phosphorylation at 694 and 780 and promotes DNA breakage and cell apoptosis via blocking STAT5a nuclear translocation Sophoridine is a quinolizidine natural product and the exploration of its derivatives has been carried out, and the potent anticancer compound IMB-HDC was acquired.

NO WAIT: new organised well-adapted immediate triage: a lean improvement project,"Long waiting times in the emergency department (ED) are associated with decreased patient satisfaction and increased morbidity and mortality. Triage may be a contributing factor to prolonged wait times in the ED. At Alhada Armed Forces Hospital (Taif, Saudi Arabia), patients other than level 1 and 2 on the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale are requested to wait until triage. During peak hours (08:00−22:00), the waiting time prior to triage is prolonged, and several patients leave the ED before triage. In this project, a multidisciplinary team was assembled to revise patient flow from the time of arrival at the ED to the time of triage. Lean methodology was used to identify the redundancies and design a seamless flow process for ED patients. Through reorganising the triage area using minimal additional resources, the project team devised a novel floor plan for the triage area which provided a unique patient flow in the ED. The median patient wait time from arrival to triage was reduced from 27 min to 4.09 min and the percentage of patients leaving the ER before triage was reduced to 0%.

Pathogen Detection in the Genomic Era,"In the 21st century, one of the greatest challenges to public health and clinical microbiologists is the rapid detection and identification of emerging and reemerging pathogens. Complex factors such as genetic variation in the host and pathogen, environmental changes, population pressures, and global travel can all influence the emergence of infectious diseases. The SARS epidemic of 2003 highlighted the potential of an emerging pathogen to spread globally in a very short time frame (Peruski and Peruski, 2003). The diagnostics of such infectious diseases has been greatly affected in the past 20 years. No longer is cultivation and microscopy the only means of detecting infectious agents. With the introduction of molecular diagnostics, the ability to detect minute amounts of microbial nucleic acids in clinical specimens has revolutionized clinical microbiology. In particular, the utility of PCR allows the detection and quantitation of specific agents in a matter of hours. PCR sequencing of specific segments of nucleic acid allows for the determination of specific drug resistance that now aids in guiding viral therapies.",0,"Pathogen Detection in the Genomic Era In the 21st century, one of the greatest challenges to public health and clinical microbiologists is the rapid detection and identification of emerging and reemerging pathogens.

Exploring the spatial heterogeneity and temporal homogeneity of ambient PM(10) in nine core cities of China,"We focus on the causes of fluctuations in wintertime PM(10) in nine regional core cities of China using two machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RF and RNN both show high performance in predicting hourly PM(10) using only gaseous air pollutants (SO(2), NO(2) and CO) as inputs, showing the predominance of the secondary inorganic aerosol and implying the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium between gaseous air pollutants and PM(10). Also, we find the following results. The correlation of gaseous air pollutants and PM(10) were more relevant than that of meteorological conditions and PM(10). CO was the predominant factor for PM(10) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Plain and the Yangtze River Delta while SO(2) and NO(2) were also important features for PM(10) in the Pearl River Delta and Sichuan Basin. The spatial heterogeneity and temporal homogeneity of PM(10) in China are revealed. The long-range transported PM(10) was substantiated to be insignificant, except in the sandstorms. The severity of PM(10) was attributable to the lopsided shift of thermodynamic equilibrium and the phenology of indigenous flora.",0,"Exploring the spatial heterogeneity and temporal homogeneity of ambient PM(10) in nine core cities of China We focus on the causes of fluctuations in wintertime PM(10) in nine regional core cities of China using two machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

STAU1 selectively regulates the expression of inflammatory and immune response genes and alternative splicing of the nerve growth factor receptor signaling pathway,"Double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen homolog 1 (STAU1) is a highly conserved multifunctional double-stranded RNA-binding protein, and is a key factor in neuronal differentiation. RNA sequencing was used to analyze the overall transcriptional levels of the upregulated cells by STAU1 and control cells, and select alternative splicing (AS). It was determined that the high expression of STAU1 led to changes in the expression levels of a variety of inflammatory and immune response genes, including IFIT2, IFIT3, OASL, and CCL2. Furthermore, STAU1 was revealed to exert a significant regulatory effect on the AS of genes related to the ‘nerve growth factor receptor signaling pathway’. This is of significant importance for neuronal survival, differentiation, growth, post-damage repair, and regeneration. In conclusion, overexpression of STAU1 was associated with immune response and regulated AS of pathways related to neuronal growth and repair.

Apolipoprotein E Binding Drives Structural and Compositional Rearrangement of mRNA-Containing Lipid Nanoparticles,"[Image: see text] Emerging therapeutic treatments based on the production of proteins by delivering mRNA have become increasingly important in recent times. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP’s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape.",0,"Apolipoprotein E Binding Drives Structural and Compositional Rearrangement of mRNA-Containing Lipid Nanoparticles [Image: see text] Emerging therapeutic treatments based on the production of proteins by delivering mRNA have become increasingly important in recent times.

Development of an Aerosol Model of Cryptococcus Reveals Humidity as an Important Factor Affecting the Viability of Cryptococcus during Aerosolization,"Cryptococcus is an emerging global health threat that is annually responsible for over 1,000,000 infections and one third of all AIDS patient deaths. There is an ongoing outbreak of cryptococcosis in the western United States and Canada. Cryptococcosis is a disease resulting from the inhalation of the infectious propagules from the environment. The current and most frequently used animal infection models initiate infection via liquid suspension through intranasal instillation or intravenous injection. These models do not replicate the typically dry nature of aerosol exposure and may hinder our ability to decipher the initial events that lead to clearance or the establishment of infection. We have established a standardized aerosol model of murine infection for the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus. Aerosolized cells were generated utilizing a Collison nebulizer in a whole-body Madison Chamber at different humidity conditions. The aerosols inside the chamber were sampled using a BioSampler to determine viable aerosol concentration and spray factor (ratio of viable aerosol concentration to total inoculum concentration). We have effectively delivered yeast and yeast-spore mixtures to the lungs of mice and observed the establishment of disease. We observed that growth conditions prior to exposure and humidity within the Madison Chamber during exposure can alter Cryptococcus survival and dose retained in mice.",0,"Development of an Aerosol Model of Cryptococcus Reveals Humidity as an Important Factor Affecting the Viability of Cryptococcus during Aerosolization Cryptococcus is an emerging global health threat that is annually responsible for over 1,000,000 infections and one third of all AIDS patient deaths.

Significance of viral glycoproteins for infectivity and pathogenicity(),"Disease resulting from virus infection is a complex event depending on the close interaction of viral and cellular factors. Through the application of biochemical and genetic methods, it is now possible to gain an insight into the molecular basis of these interactions. Thus, it has been shown that the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses play a central role in the initiation of infection. They are responsible not only for the adsorption of virions to cellular receptors, but are also for the entry of the genome into the cell by the fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes. Evidence is growing that the fusogenic glycoproteins are frequently activated by cellular proteases. The structure of the proteins at the cleavage site and the availability of a suitable protease are critical for tissue tropism, spread of the virus in the infected organism and, thus, for pathogenicity. This will be demonstrated here by the example of the haemagglutinin of influenza viruses.",0,"Significance of viral glycoproteins for infectivity and pathogenicity() Disease resulting from virus infection is a complex event depending on the close interaction of viral and cellular factors.

A discrete-time analog for coupled within-host and between-host dynamics in environmentally driven infectious disease,"In this paper, we establish a discrete-time analog for coupled within-host and between-host systems for an environmentally driven infectious disease with fast and slow two time scales by using the non-standard finite difference scheme. The system is divided into a fast time system and a slow time system by using the idea of limit equations. For the fast system, the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the basic reproduction number and the existence for infection-free and unique virus infectious equilibria are obtained, and the threshold conditions on the local stability of equilibria are established. In the slow system, except for the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the existence for disease-free, unique endemic and two endemic equilibria are obtained, and the sufficient conditions on the local stability for disease-free and unique endemic equilibria are established. To return to the coupling system, the local stability for the virus- and disease-free equilibrium, and virus infectious but disease-free equilibrium is established. The numerical examples show that an endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and the other one is unstable when there are two endemic equilibria.",0,"A discrete-time analog for coupled within-host and between-host dynamics in environmentally driven infectious disease In this paper, we establish a discrete-time analog for coupled within-host and between-host systems for an environmentally driven infectious disease with fast and slow two time scales by using the non-standard finite difference scheme.

miR-615 Fine-Tunes Growth and Development and Has a Role in Cancer and in Neural Repair,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as epigenetic modulators regulating almost any gene expression. Similarly, other noncoding RNAs, as well as epigenetic modifications, can regulate miRNAs.

In the present review, we focus on miR-615, a miRNA highly conserved across eutherian mammals. It is involved not only during embryogenesis in the regulation of growth and development, for instance during osteogenesis and angiogenesis, but also in the regulation of cell growth and the proliferation and migration of cells, acting as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter. It therefore serves as a biomarker for several types of cancer, and recently has also been found to be involved in reparative processes and neural repair. In addition, we present the pleiad of functions in which miR-615 is involved, as well as their multiple target genes and the multiple regulatory molecules involved in its own expression.

Viral-Bacterial Synergistic Interaction in Respiratory Disease,"Humans and animals are constantly inoculated with various microorganisms resident in the upper respiratory tract and by inhaled aerosols, yet pneumonia is a relatively rare event. This implies the existence of very efficient defense mechanisms that are capable of eliminating the vast majority of microorganisms before they colonize and multiply to sufficient levels, resulting in clinical diseases. In order to overcome this continuous barrage of microorganisms, there is a complex array of defense mechanisms present in the upper and lower respiratory tract capable of eradicating these organisms. However, in individuals suffering from a variety of diseases, including virus infections, colonization occurs rapidly with subsequent development of pneumonia. Thus, it is estimated that 90% of bacterial pneumonias develop after a viral infection. Furthermore, individuals suffering from a viral pneumonia have a 40% chance of developing bacterial pneumonia. The reasons for the increased colonization of the lung by bacteria following virus infections are related to the surface properties of epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, the physiological environment of the respiratory tract, and the alteration of the specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms of the lung that occurs as a result of virus infection.",0,"Viral-Bacterial Synergistic Interaction in Respiratory Disease Humans and animals are constantly inoculated with various microorganisms resident in the upper respiratory tract and by inhaled aerosols, yet pneumonia is a relatively rare event. This implies the existence of very efficient defense mechanisms that are capable of eliminating the vast majority of microorganisms before they colonize and multiply to sufficient levels, resulting in clinical diseases. In order to overcome this continuous barrage of microorganisms, there is a complex array of defense mechanisms present in the upper and lower respiratory tract capable of eradicating these organisms.

Taiwan's Experience in Hospital Preparedness and Response for Emerging Infectious Diseases,"The Communicable Disease Control Medical Network (CDCMN), established in 2003 after the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, has undergone several phases of modification in structure and activation. The main organizing principles of the CDCMN are centralized isolation of patients with severe highly infectious diseases and centralization of medical resources, as well as a network of designated regional hospitals like those in other countries. The CDCMN is made up of a command system, responding hospitals, and supporting hospitals. It was tested and activated in response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009-10 and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2016, and it demonstrated high-level functioning and robust capacity. In this article, the history, structure, and operation of the CDCMN is introduced globally for the first time, and the advantages and challenges of this system are discussed. The Taiwanese experience shows an example of a collaboration between the public health system and the medical system that may help other public health authorities plan management and hospital preparedness for highly infectious diseases.",0,"Taiwan's Experience in Hospital Preparedness and Response for Emerging Infectious Diseases The Communicable Disease Control Medical Network (CDCMN), established in 2003 after the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, has undergone several phases of modification in structure and activation.

Establishing Standardized Documentation for Anaphylaxis Treatment in a Tertiary Care Pediatric Allergy Clinic,"INTRODUCTION: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Common allergy clinic procedures, including oral food challenges and subcutaneous immunotherapy, carry a risk of anaphylaxis, the treatment for which is epinephrine. Our goal was to develop a standardized process for the management and documentation of allergic reactions that occur in a tertiary care pediatric allergy clinic. METHODS: This was a single institution quality improvement pilot study. A multidisciplinary team from the allergy department designed, implemented, and studied the use of a standardized form for the documentation and treatment of allergic reactions within the clinic. RESULTS: A standardized form was developed based on evidence-based guidelines for the management of allergic reactions and included space for documentation. Both clinic providers and staff approved the form. One year after the introduction, we reached 100% adherence for the use of the form in visits during which a patient experienced a severe allergic reaction requiring epinephrine. Two patients required transfer to the emergency room; the quality improvement form was utilized in these cases to document treatment and assist with the hand-off to emergency room personnel before transfer. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a standardized form for the treatment and documentation of anaphylaxis within our allergy clinic. The next steps focus on further integrating this form into the electronic medical record, determining compliance with evidence-based management of anaphylaxis, and formally assessing the use of the form as a handoff tool in the event of patient transfer.",0,"Establishing Standardized Documentation for Anaphylaxis Treatment in a Tertiary Care Pediatric Allergy Clinic INTRODUCTION: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.

Molecular Mechanisms for the Mechanical Modulation of Airway Responsiveness,"The smooth muscle of the airways is exposed to continuously changing mechanical forces during normal breathing. The mechanical oscillations that occur during breathing have profound effects on airway tone and airway responsiveness both in experimental animals and humans in vivo and in isolated airway tissues in vitro. Experimental evidence suggests that alterations in the contractile and mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle tissues caused by mechanical perturbations result from adaptive changes in the organization of the cytoskeletal architecture of the smooth muscle cell. The cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that undergoes rapid reorganization in response to external mechanical and pharmacologic stimuli. Contractile stimulation initiates the assembly of cytoskeletal/extracellular matrix adhesion complex proteins into large macromolecular signaling complexes (adhesomes) that undergo activation to mediate the polymerization and reorganization of a submembranous network of actin filaments at the cortex of the cell. Cortical actin polymerization is catalyzed by Neuronal-Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex, which are activated by pathways regulated by paxillin and the small GTPase, cdc42. These processes create a strong and rigid cytoskeletal framework that may serve to strengthen the membrane for the transmission of force generated by the contractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix, and to enable the adaptation of smooth muscle cells to mechanical stresses. This model for the regulation of airway smooth muscle function can provide novel perspectives to explain the normal physiologic behavior of the airways and pathophysiologic properties of the airways in asthma.",0,"Molecular Mechanisms for the Mechanical Modulation of Airway Responsiveness The smooth muscle of the airways is exposed to continuously changing mechanical forces during normal breathing.

A review on the eco-epidemiology and clinical management of human granulocytic anaplasmosis and its agent in Europe,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the agent of tick-borne fever, equine, canine and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. The common route of A. phagocytophilum transmission is through a tick bite, the main vector in Europe being Ixodes ricinus. Despite the apparently ubiquitous presence of the pathogen A. phagocytophilum in ticks and various wild and domestic animals from Europe, up to date published clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) remain rare compared to the worldwide status. It is unclear if this reflects the epidemiological dynamics of the human infection in Europe or if the disease is underdiagnosed or underreported. Epidemiologic studies in Europe have suggested an increased occupational risk of infection for forestry workers, hunters, veterinarians, and farmers with a tick-bite history and living in endemic areas. Although the overall genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum in Europe is higher than in the USA, the strains responsible for the human infections are related on both continents. However, the study of the genetic variability and assessment of the difference of pathogenicity and infectivity between strains to various hosts has been insufficiently explored to date. Most of the European HGA cases presented as a mild infection, common clinical signs being pyrexia, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The diagnosis of HGA in the USA was recommended to be based on clinical signs and the patient’s history and later confirmed using specialized laboratory tests. However, in Europe since the majority of cases are presenting as mild infection, laboratory tests may be performed before the treatment in order to avoid antibiotic overuse. The drug of choice for HGA is doxycycline and because of potential for serious complication the treatment should be instituted on clinical suspicion alone.",0,"A review on the eco-epidemiology and clinical management of human granulocytic anaplasmosis and its agent in Europe Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the agent of tick-borne fever, equine, canine and human granulocytic anaplasmosis.

The Implications of ncRNAs in the Development of Human Diseases,"The mammalian genome comprehends a small minority of genes that encode for proteins (barely 2% of the total genome in humans) and an immense majority of genes that are transcribed into RNA but not encoded for proteins (ncRNAs). These non-coding genes are intimately related to the expression regulation of protein-coding genes. The ncRNAs subtypes differ in their size, so there are long non-coding genes (lncRNAs) and other smaller ones, like microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Due to their important role in the maintenance of cellular functioning, any deregulation of the expression profiles of these ncRNAs can dissemble in the development of different types of diseases. Among them, we can highlight some of high incidence in the population, such as cancer, neurodegenerative, or cardiovascular disorders. In addition, thanks to the enormous advances in the field of medical genomics, these same ncRNAs are starting to be used as possible drugs, approved by the FDA, as an effective treatment for diseases.",0,"The Implications of ncRNAs in the Development of Human Diseases The mammalian genome comprehends a small minority of genes that encode for proteins (barely 2% of the total genome in humans) and an immense majority of genes that are transcribed into RNA but not encoded for proteins (ncRNAs).

Initiator or Intermediary? A Case Study on Network Relation of Environmental Regulatory Capture in China,"Behind the environmental regulatory capture (ERC) lies a complex network of interactions and interests. Identifying the roles of stakeholders in the ERC network and their behavioral motives can illuminate the mechanism of ERC incidents, and provide policy recommendations for reducing other types of regulatory capture. Drawing on the regulatory capture and principal-agent theories, this study develops a triple-layer principal-agent model of environmental regulation practices in China. We further conduct a social network analysis (SNA) on the ERC case in the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) of Bobai County, Guangxi Province, China to illustrate the hidden interactions and interest transmission structure among stakeholders in ERC. The results show that the ERC presents obvious characteristics of concealment and complexity, and individual capture often evolves into collective capture. Different stakeholders are in different positions and play different roles in the network. The environmental regulatory authority, the commissioned regulatory agency, and the agency of enterprises form the core power circle of the ERC network, in which the first two play the role of intermediary and the latter acts as an initiator. They together occupy the structural hole position and dominate the evolution of the ERC network. Peripheral structure stakeholders play the role of “bridge” and profit from the expanding ERC network. It is recommended that the principle of decentralization and the balance of power must be taken into consideration. Quantitative analysis methods such as SNA should be applied to clarify accountability when punishing responsible persons. More subjects are also encouraged to participate in environmental regulations and report illegal acts actively. Finally, a blacklist system should be established in the field of environmental protection for regulating the professional and social morality of all parties.",0,"Initiator or Intermediary?

The measurements and parameters from them were compared to those of 12 male adult human subjects. Additionally, 10 live male subjects were scanned by magnetic resonance imaging, and the width and depth of the spinal cord and spinal canal and the thickness of the anterior and posterior cerebrospinal fluid were measured and compared to the relevant parameters of 10 male adult human subjects. The tendency of cervical parameters to change with segmental changes was similar between species.

"Charge-Transfer Complex of Linifanib with 2,3-dichloro-3,5-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone: Synthesis, Spectroscopic Characterization, Computational Molecular Modelling and Application in the Development of Novel 96-microwell Spectrophotometric Assay","BACKGROUND: Linifanib (LFB) is a multi‐targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and other types of cancer. The charge-transfer (CT) interaction of LFB is important in studying its receptor binding mechanisms and useful in the development of a reliable CT-based spectrophotometric assay for LFB in its pharmaceutical formulation to assure its therapeutic benefits. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the CT reaction of LFB with 2,3-dichloro-3,5-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) and its application in the development of a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. METHODS: The reaction was investigated, its conditions were optimized, the physicochemical and constants of the CT complex and stoichiometric ratio of the complex were determined. The solid-state LFB-DDQ complex was synthesized and its structure was analyzed by UV-visible, FT-IR, and (1)H-NMR spectroscopic techniques, and also by the computational molecular modeling. The reaction was employed in the development of a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. RESULTS: The reaction resulted in the formation of a red-colored product, and the spectrophotometric investigations confirmed that the reaction had a CT nature. The molar absorptivity of the complex was linearly correlated with the dielectric constant and polarity index of the solvent; the correlation coefficients were 0.9526 and 0.9459, respectively. The stoichiometric ratio of LFB:DDQ was 1:2. The spectroscopic and computational data confirmed the sites of interaction on the LFB molecule, and accordingly, the reaction mechanism was postulated. The reaction was utilized in the development of the first 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. The assay limits of detection and quantitation were 1.31 and 3.96 μg/well, respectively. The assay was successfully applied to the analysis of LFB in its bulk and tablets with high accuracy and precision.

The impact of the oral cavity in febrile neutropenia and infectious complications in patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an inflammatory response causing fever that may develop during cancer therapy-induced neutropenia. FN may herald life-threatening infectious complications and should therefore be considered a medical emergency. Patients presenting with FN are routinely subjected to careful history taking and physical examination including X-rays and microbiological evaluations. Nevertheless, an infection is documented clinically in only 20–30% of cases, whereas a causative microbial pathogen is not identified in over 70% of FN cases. The oral cavity is generally only visually inspected. Although it is recognized that ulcerative oral mucositis may be involved in the development of FN, the contribution of infections of the periodontium, the dentition, and salivary glands may be underestimated. These infections can be easily overlooked, as symptoms and signs of inflammation may be limited or absent during neutropenia. This narrative review is aimed to inform the clinician on the potential role of the oral cavity as a potential source in the development of FN. Areas for future research directed to advancing optimal management strategies are discussed.",0,"The impact of the oral cavity in febrile neutropenia and infectious complications in patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an inflammatory response causing fever that may develop during cancer therapy-induced neutropenia.

"Sexual Dimorphisms, Anti-Hormonal Therapy and Cardiac Arrhythmias","Significant variations from the normal QT interval range of 350 to 450 milliseconds (ms) in men and 360 to 460 ms in women increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias. This difference in the QT interval between men and women has led to the understanding of the influence of sex hormones on the role of gender-specific channelopathies and development of ventricular arrhythmias. The QT interval, which represents the duration of ventricular repolarization of the heart, can be affected by androgen levels, resulting in a sex-specific predilection for acquired and inherited channelopathies such as acquired long QT syndrome in women and Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome in men. Manipulation of the homeostasis of these sex hormones as either hormonal therapy for certain cancers, recreational therapy or family planning and in transgender treatment has also been shown to affect QT interval duration and increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias. In this review, we highlight the effects of endogenous and exogenous sex hormones in the physiological and pathological states on QTc variation and predisposition to gender-specific pro-arrhythmias.",0,"Sexual Dimorphisms, Anti-Hormonal Therapy and Cardiac Arrhythmias Significant variations from the normal QT interval range of 350 to 450 milliseconds (ms) in men and 360 to 460 ms in women increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias.

Vaccines for preventing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections in farm animals,"Fimbrial vaccines are routinely given parenterally to pregnant cattle, sheep and swine to protect suckling newborn calves, lambs and pigs against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections. Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal period when the antibody titres in colostrum and milk are highest; (2) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types: (3) fimbriae consist of good protein antigens on the bacterial surface where they are readily accessible to antibody; (4) fimbriae are required for a critical step (adhesion-colonization) early in the pathogenesis of the disease. ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem in farm animals in spite of extensive use of fimbriae-based vaccines. Definitive data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines in field use are not available. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective, that the problem occurs chiefly among non-vaccinated animals, and that in some herds vaccination moves peak prevalence of disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, when mortality is lower. It has been suggested that extensive use of vaccines will rapidly select for the emergence of novel or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigen types. There is no evidence that this has happened after a decade of routine vaccine use in the United States. However, there is no active direct surveillance for such emergence. In contrast to the rational development of vaccines to provide passive lacteal protection against ETEC in suckling neonates, comparatively little progress has been made in providing the knowledge required for development of vaccines to protect against postweaning ETEC infections in swine.",0,"Vaccines for preventing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections in farm animals Fimbrial vaccines are routinely given parenterally to pregnant cattle, sheep and swine to protect suckling newborn calves, lambs and pigs against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections.

Functional and molecular analysis of mitochondria in thyroid oncocytoma,"We report a functional and molecular analysis of nine oncocytic tumors of the human thyroid. In all the abundance of mitochondria observed ultrastructurally was accompanied by an increase in enzymatic activities of respiratory complexes I (NADH dehydrogenase), II (succinate dehydrogenase) IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and V (ATPase). Western blot analysis failed to detect uncoupling protein in the tumors. The elevated respiratory enzyme activities were paralleled by an increase in the mitochondrial DNA content. Restriction analysis of mitochondrial DNA gave no indication of heteroplasmy or other gross alterations.

We validate the generality of our theoretical findings in real-world partially observed systems representing infectious disease outbreaks, online discussions, and software development projects.

The Monoclonal Antibody Recognized the Open Reading Frame Protein in Porcine Circovirus Type 2-Infected Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells,"The purpose of this study in the context of the open reading frame 3 (ORF3) protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was especially its location and its relation to the capsid protein and the apoptosis protein in PCV2-infected porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To detect the ORF3 protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated in this study. The mAb 7D3 binds to the ORF3 peptide (residues 35–66) and the native ORF3 protein in PCV2-infected PBMCs, as shown by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The data show that 3–5% of PBMCs were positive for ORF3 protein or p53 protein. Further, 78–82% of PBMCs were positive for the capsid. This study confirmed the ORF3 protein not only colocalized with the capsid protein but also colocalized with the p53 protein in PBMCs. Immunoassays were conducted in this study to detect the capsid protein, the ORF3 protein, anti-capsid IgG, and anti-ORF3 IgG. The data show the correlation (r = 0.758) of the ORF3 protein and the capsid protein in the blood samples from the PCV2-infected herd. However, each anti-viral protein IgG had a different curve of the profile in the same herd after vaccination.

Targeting by AutophaGy proteins (TAG): Targeting of IFNG-inducible GTPases to membranes by the LC3 conjugation system of autophagy,"LC3 has been used as a marker to locate autophagosomes. However, it is also well established that LC3 can localize on various membranous structures other than autophagosomes. We recently demonstrated that the LC3 conjugation system (ATG7, ATG3, and ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1) is required to target LC3 and IFNG (interferon, gamma)-inducible GTPases to the parasitophorus vacuole membrane (PVM) of a protist parasite Toxoplasma gondii and consequently for IFNG to control T. gondii infection. Here we show that not only LC3, but also its homologs (GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2) localize on the PVM of T. gondii in a conjugation-dependent manner. Knockout/knockdown of all LC3 homologs led to a significant reduction in targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the PVM of T. gondii and the IFNG-mediated control of T. gondii infection. Furthermore, when we relocated the ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, which specifies the conjugation site of LC3 homologs, to alternative target membranes, the IFNG-inducible GTPases were targeted to the new target membranes rather than the PVM of T. gondii. These data suggest that the localization of LC3 homologs onto a membrane by the LC3 conjugation system is necessary and sufficient for targeting of the IFNG-inducible GTPases to the membrane, implying Targeting by AutophaGy proteins (TAG). Our data further suggest that the conjugation of ubiquitin-like LC3 homologs to the phospholipids of membranes may change the destiny of the membranes beyond degradation through lysosomal fusion, as the conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins changes the destiny of the proteins beyond proteasomal degradation.",0,"Targeting by AutophaGy proteins (TAG): Targeting of IFNG-inducible GTPases to membranes by the LC3 conjugation system of autophagy LC3 has been used as a marker to locate autophagosomes.

These data suggest that alterations in the alpha (1 D) protein may be responsible for the phenotypic changes by the mutants. A delay in detectable virus-specified protein synthesis was exhibited in mutant-infected cells in comparison to wild-type.

The Interplay between Immunosenescence and Microbiota in the Efficacy of Vaccines,"Vaccinations are among the most effective medical procedures and have had an incredible impact on almost everyone’s life. One of the populations that can benefit the most from them are elderly people. Unfortunately, in this group, vaccines are less effective than in other groups, due to immunosenescence. The immune system ages like the whole body and becomes less effective in responding to infections and vaccinations. At the same time, immunosenescence also favors an inflammatory microenvironment, which is linked to many conditions typical of the geriatrics population. The microbiota is one of the key actors in modulating the immune response and, in this review, we discuss the current evidence on the role of microbiota in regulating the immune response to vaccines, particularly in elderly people.",0,"The Interplay between Immunosenescence and Microbiota in the Efficacy of Vaccines Vaccinations are among the most effective medical procedures and have had an incredible impact on almost everyone’s life.

Prevention and Psychological Intervention in Depression and Stress-Related Conditions,"This chapter focuses on depression and stress-related conditions to discuss possible strategies for the prevention or early management of such conditions. Health education constitutes the first important strategy, and we outline a school-based educational activity using a case-method approach. We next illustrate the impact of stressful events on psychological health with the results of a survey among Chinese individuals conducted after an unexpected epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. Communication plays an important role in the assessment and management services provided by medical practitioners to sick individuals, with very diverse backgrounds and levels of medical knowledge, who consult health care providers with concerns about their health. In this context, we introduce a recent advance in patient–doctor communication. Finally, we address the cognitive and behavioral features of those who suffer from depression and psychosocial stress. Based on our recent activities and on evidence pertaining to health promotion and education, we emphasize the importance of health education and communication in the prevention of stress-related diseases and the promotion of physical and psychological health.",0,"Prevention and Psychological Intervention in Depression and Stress-Related Conditions This chapter focuses on depression and stress-related conditions to discuss possible strategies for the prevention or early management of such conditions.

Estimating a Markovian Epidemic Model Using Household Serial Interval Data from the Early Phase of an Epidemic,"The clinical serial interval of an infectious disease is the time between date of symptom onset in an index case and the date of symptom onset in one of its secondary cases. It is a quantity which is commonly collected during a pandemic and is of fundamental importance to public health policy and mathematical modelling. In this paper we present a novel method for calculating the serial interval distribution for a Markovian model of household transmission dynamics. This allows the use of Bayesian MCMC methods, with explicit evaluation of the likelihood, to fit to serial interval data and infer parameters of the underlying model. We use simulated and real data to verify the accuracy of our methodology and illustrate the importance of accounting for household size. The output of our approach can be used to produce posterior distributions of population level epidemic characteristics.",0,"Estimating a Markovian Epidemic Model Using Household Serial Interval Data from the Early Phase of an Epidemic The clinical serial interval of an infectious disease is the time between date of symptom onset in an index case and the date of symptom onset in one of its secondary cases.

Cytokines Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Interleukin 10 (IL-10) Gene Polymorphisms as Potential Host Susceptibility Factors in Virus-Induced Encephalitis,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze and explore the relationship between the cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in relation to gene polymorphism and their respective effects on the susceptibility to virus-induced encephalitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: From January 2012 to June 2013, 112 patients with virus-induced encephalitis (the case group and 109 healthy individuals (the control group) were recruited for the purposes of this study. The functional variations that IL-4 and IL-10 genes exhibit were detected through the use of a function analysis and selection tool for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (FASTSNP). The genotypes of IL-4 were rs2227283 and IL-4 rs2227288, and the genotypes of IL-10 were rs1800871 and IL-10 rs1800872. These genotypes were respectively assessed using direct sequencing. RESULTS: IL-4 rs2227283 and IL-10 rs1800871 have no correlation in with risk of virus-induced encephalitis (both P>0.05) GA and AA genotypes were related to IL-4 rs2227288 and GT, while TT and GT + TT genotypes were related to IL-10 rs1800872. These were highlighted as being risk factors in virus-induced encephalitis (all P<0.05). However, the duration of fever, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, and lymphocytes and monocytes of virus-induced encephalitis patients with IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 all displayed significant differences (all P<0.05). Frequencies of GAGT and CAGT haplotypes were evaluated and deemed to be of statistical significance and subsequently were highlighted as being risk factors in virus-induced encephalitis (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 may contribute to an increased risk for virus-induced encephalitis.

"The national rate of intensive care units-acquired infections, one-year retrospective study in Iran","BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in intensive care units (ICUs) are among the avoidable morbidity and mortality causes. This study aimed at investigating the rate of ICU-acquired infections (ICU-AIs) in Iran. METHODS: For the purpose of this multi-center study, the rate of ICU-AIs calculated based on the data collected through Iranian nosocomial infections surveillance system and hospital information system. The data expanded based on 12 months of the year (13,632 records in terms of “hospital-ward-month”), and then, the last observation carried forward method was used to replace the missing data. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age of 52,276 patients with HAIs in the ICUs was 47.37 (30.78) years. The overall rate of ICU-AIs was 96.61 per 1000 patients and 16.82 per 1000 patient-days in Iran’s hospitals. The three main HAIs in the general ICUs were ventilator-associated events (VAE), urinary tract infection (UTI), and pneumonia events & lower respiratory tract infection (PNEU & LRI) infections. The three main HAIs in the internal and surgical ICUs were VAE, UTI, and bloodstream infections/surgical site infections (BSI/SSI). The most prevalent HAIs were BSI, PNEU & LRI and eye, ear, nose, throat, or mouth (EENT) infections in the neonatal ICU and PNEU & LRI, VAE, and BSI in the PICU. Device, catheter, and ventilator-associated infections accounted for 60.96, 18.56, and 39.83% of ICU-AIs, respectively. The ventilator-associated infection rate was 26.29 per 1000 ventilator-days. Based on the Pabon Lasso model, the lowest rates of ICU-AIs (66.95 per 1000 patients and 15.19 patient-days) observed in zone III, the efficient area. CONCLUSIONS: HAIs are common in the internal ICU wards. In fact, VAE and ventilator-related infections are more prevalent in Iran. HAIs in the ICUs leads to an increased risk of ICU-related mortality. Therefore, to reduce ICU-AIs, the specific and trained personnel must be responsible for the use of the devices (catheter use and ventilators), avoid over use of catheterization when possible, and remove catheters earlier.

De novo RNA synthesis and homology modeling of the classical swine fever virus RNA polymerase,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme which initiates RNA replication by a de novo mechanism without a primer and is a potential target for anti-virus therapy. We expressed the NS5B protein in Escherichia coli. The rGTP can stimulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and mutation of the GDD motif to Gly–Asp–Asp (GAA) abolishes the RNA synthesis. To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis in CSFV, a three-dimensional model was built by homology modeling based on the alignment with several virus RdRps. The model contains 605 residues folded in the characteristic fingers, palm and thumb domains. The fingers domain contains an N-terminal region that plays an important role in conformational change. We propose that the experimentally observed promotion of polymerase efficiency by rGTP is probably due to the conformational changes of the polymerase caused by binding the rGTP. Mutation of the GDD to GAA interferes with the interaction between the residues at the polymerase active site and metal ions, and thus renders the polymerase inactive.",0,"De novo RNA synthesis and homology modeling of the classical swine fever virus RNA polymerase Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme which initiates RNA replication by a de novo mechanism without a primer and is a potential target for anti-virus therapy.

Development of VHH Antibodies against Dengue Virus Type 2 NS1 and Comparison with Monoclonal Antibodies for Use in Immunological Diagnosis,"The possibility of using variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies) as diagnostic tools for dengue virus (DENV) type 2 NS1 protein was investigated and compared with the use of conventional monoclonal antibodies. After successful expression of DENV type 2 NS1 protein, the genes of VHH antibodies against NS1 protein were biopanned from a non-immune llama library by phage display. VHH antibodies were then expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Simultaneously, monoclonal antibodies were obtained by the conventional route. Sequence analysis of the VHH antibodies revealed novel and long complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3). Epitope mapping was performed via a phage display peptide library using purified VHH and monoclonal antibodies as targets. Interestingly, the same region of NS1, which comprises amino acids (224)HWPKPHTLW(232), was conserved for both kinds of antibodies displaying the consensus motif histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan or tryptophan-proline-tryptophan. The two types of antibodies were used to prepare rapid diagnostic kits based on immunochromatographic assay. The VHH antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit showed better sensitivity and specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit, which might be due to the long CDR3 regions of the VHH antibodies and their ability to bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen. This demonstrates that VHH antibodies are likely to be an option for developing point-of-care tests against DENV infection.",0,"Development of VHH Antibodies against Dengue Virus Type 2 NS1 and Comparison with Monoclonal Antibodies for Use in Immunological Diagnosis The possibility of using variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies) as diagnostic tools for dengue virus (DENV) type 2 NS1 protein was investigated and compared with the use of conventional monoclonal antibodies.

Metabolic complications of hepatitis C virus infection,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a systemic disease that is implicated in multiple extrahepatic organ dysfunction contributing to its protean manifestations. HCV is associated with diverse extrahepatic disorders including atherosclerosis, glucose and lipid metabolic disturbances, alterations in the iron metabolic pathways, and lymphoproliferative diseases over and above the traditional liver manifestations of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The orchestration between HCV major proteins and the liver-muscle-adipose axis, poses a major burden on the global health of human body organs, if not adequately addressed. The close and inseparable associations between chronic HCV infection, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular disorders are specifically important considering the increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome, and their economic burden to patients, the healthcare systems, and society. Cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the interplay of these organs and tissues in health and disease are therefore of significant interest. The coexistence of metabolic disorders and chronic hepatitis C infection also enhances the progression to liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The presence of metabolic disorders is believed to influence the chronicity and virulence of HCV leading to liver disease progression.

Socio-religious Prognosticators of Psychosocial Burden of Beta Thalassemia Major,"The study investigates the socio-religious factors in the propagation of genetically inherited disease of Beta thalassemia. The disorder which reportedly has a significant protraction through repeated cousin marriages results in the social maladjustment of the parents of the sick children due to constant depression, anxiety, and weak social interaction and may lead to social isolation as well. This research aims to find out the significant effect of socio-religious trends on psychosocial burden of beta thalassemia major among cousin and non-cousin couples in the province of Punjab in Pakistan. It takes a sample of 932 parents of sick children, among whom 735 were married with cousins and 197 with non-cousins, for data collection. The findings reveal that inadequate knowledge of the disease, insufficient or misdirected social support, stigmatization, and marriage breakups caused by the disease, superstitions, and misinterpretations of religion and the subsequent practices accordingly as significant predictors of psychosocial burden of beta thalassemia major among non-cousins and cousin couples. Additionally, it also finds patriarchy as only significant predictors of outcome variable among cousin couples.",0,"Socio-religious Prognosticators of Psychosocial Burden of Beta Thalassemia Major The study investigates the socio-religious factors in the propagation of genetically inherited disease of Beta thalassemia.

Reinvention of interorganizational systems: A case analysis of the diffusion of a bio-terror surveillance system,"Innovation diffusion theory proposed that adopters—whether individuals or organizations—sometimes reinvent an innovation as they gain experience using it. Reinvention can enhance (or impede) the likelihood of an IS innovation’s acceptance and further diffusion. This paper reports on a case study of BioSense, an interorganizational system that was designed as an early detection tool for bio-terror attacks and subsequently modified to better serve this need as well as to operate as a public health system for pinpointing geographic clusters of dangerous/acute disease outbreaks. By examining the interplay among the political and organizational dynamics and technical properties of the BioSense system, we shed light on processes affecting reinvention in an interorganizational context. We discuss our findings in light of theories of the diffusion and reinvention of innovations. We use Rogers’ (1995) list of factors supporting reinvention to structure the discussion of the fidelity and uniformity of the innovation within the processes it supports in adopting health services organizations.",0,"Reinvention of interorganizational systems: A case analysis of the diffusion of a bio-terror surveillance system Innovation diffusion theory proposed that adopters—whether individuals or organizations—sometimes reinvent an innovation as they gain experience using it.

Angiotensin II plasma levels are linked to disease severity and predict fatal outcomes in H7N9-infected patients,"A novel influenza A (H7N9) virus of avian origin emerged in eastern China in the spring of 2013. This virus causes severe disease in humans, including acute and often lethal respiratory failure. As of January 2014, 275 cases of H7N9-infected patients had been reported, highlighting the urgency of identifying biomarkers for predicting disease severity and fatal outcomes. Here, we show that plasma levels of angiotensin II, a major regulatory peptide of the renin–angiotensin system, are markedly elevated in H7N9 patients and are associated with disease progression. Moreover, the sustained high levels of angiotensin II in these patients are strongly correlated with mortality. The predictive value of angiotensin II is higher than that of C-reactive protein and some clinical parameters such as the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen). Our findings indicate that angiotensin II is a biomarker for lethality in flu infections.

Musculoskeletal Progenitor/Stromal Cell-Derived Mitochondria Modulate Cell Differentiation and Therapeutical Function,"Musculoskeletal stromal cells’ (MSCs’) metabolism impacts cell differentiation as well as immune function. During osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, BM-MSCs show a preference for glycolysis during proliferation but shift to an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-dependent metabolism. The MSC immunoregulatory fate is achieved with cell polarization, and the result is sustained production of immunoregulatory molecules (including PGE2, HGF, IL1RA, IL6, IL8, IDO activity) in response to inflammatory stimuli. MSCs adapt their energetic metabolism when acquiring immunomodulatory property and shift to aerobic glycolysis. This can be achieved via hypoxia, pretreatment with small molecule-metabolic mediators such as oligomycin, or AKT/mTOR pathway modulation. The immunoregulatory effect of MSC on macrophages polarization and Th17 switch is related to the glycolytic status of the MSC. Indeed, MSCs pretreated with oligomycin decreased the M1/M2 ratio, inhibited T-CD4 proliferation, and prevented Th17 switch. Mitochondrial activity also impacts MSC metabolism. In the bone marrow, MSCs are present in a quiescent, low proliferation, but they keep their multi-progenitor function. In this stage, they appear to be glycolytic with active mitochondria (MT) status. During MSC expansion, we observed a metabolic shift toward OXPhos, coupled with an increased MT activity. An increased production of ROS and dysfunctional mitochondria is associated with the metabolic shift to glycolysis. In contrast, when MSC underwent chondro or osteoblast differentiation, they showed a decreased glycolysis and inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In parallel the mitochondrial enzymatic activities increased associated with oxidative phosphorylation enhancement. MSCs respond to damaged or inflamed tissue through the transfer of MT to injured and immune cells, conveying a type of signaling that contributes to the restoration of cell homeostasis and immune function. The delivery of MT into injured cells increased ATP levels which in turn maintained cellular bioenergetics and recovered cell functions. MSC-derived MT may be transferred via tunneling nanotubes to undifferentiated cardiomyocytes and leading to their maturation. In this review, we will decipher the pathways and the mechanisms responsible for mitochondria transfer and activity. The eventual reversal of the metabolic and pro-inflammatory profile induced by the MT transfer will open new avenues for the control of inflammatory diseases.",0,"Musculoskeletal Progenitor/Stromal Cell-Derived Mitochondria Modulate Cell Differentiation and Therapeutical Function Musculoskeletal stromal cells’ (MSCs’) metabolism impacts cell differentiation as well as immune function.
