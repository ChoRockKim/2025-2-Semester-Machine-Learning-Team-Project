"Phylogenetic Exploration of Nosocomial Transmission Chains of 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 among Children Admitted at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa in 2011","Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation. Common hospital-acquired infections like influenza require a discerning ability to distinguish between viral isolates to accurately identify patient transmission chains. We assessed whether influenza hemagglutinin sequence phylogenies can be used to enrich epidemiological data when investigating the extent of nosocomial transmission over a four-month period within a paediatric Hospital in Cape Town South Africa. Possible transmission chains/channels were initially determined through basic patient admission data combined with Maximum likelihood and time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. These analyses suggested that most instances of potential hospital-acquired infections resulted from multiple introductions of Influenza A into the hospital, which included instances where virus hemagglutinin sequences were identical between different patients. Furthermore, a general inability to establish epidemiological transmission linkage of patients/viral isolates implied that identified isolates could have originated from asymptomatic hospital patients, visitors or hospital staff. In contrast, a traditional epidemiological investigation that used no viral phylogenetic analyses, based on patient co-admission into specific wards during a particular time-frame, suggested that multiple hospital acquired infection instances may have stemmed from a limited number of identifiable index viral isolates/patients. This traditional epidemiological analysis by itself could incorrectly suggest linkage between unrelated cases, underestimate the number of unique infections and may overlook the possible diffuse nature of hospital transmission, which was suggested by sequencing data to be caused by multiple unique introductions of influenza A isolates into individual hospital wards. We have demonstrated a functional role for viral sequence data in nosocomial transmission investigation through its ability to enrich traditional, non-molecular observational epidemiological investigation by teasing out possible transmission pathways and working toward more accurately enumerating the number of possible transmission events.",0,"Phylogenetic Exploration of Nosocomial Transmission Chains of 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 among Children Admitted at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa in 2011 Traditional modes of investigating influenza nosocomial transmission have entailed a combination of confirmatory molecular diagnostic testing and epidemiological investigation.

Forecasting influenza in Europe using a metapopulation model incorporating cross-border commuting and air travel,"Past work has shown that models incorporating human travel can improve the quality of influenza forecasts. Here, we develop and validate a metapopulation model of twelve European countries, in which international translocation of virus is driven by observed commuting and air travel flows, and use this model to generate influenza forecasts in conjunction with incidence data from the World Health Organization. We find that, although the metapopulation model fits the data well, it offers no improvement over isolated models in forecast quality. We discuss several potential reasons for these results. In particular, we note the need for data that are more comparable from country to country, and offer suggestions as to how surveillance systems might be improved to achieve this goal.",0,"Forecasting influenza in Europe using a metapopulation model incorporating cross-border commuting and air travel Past work has shown that models incorporating human travel can improve the quality of influenza forecasts.

Targeted inhibition of immunodeficiency virus replication in lymphocytes through retroviral mediated gene transfer,"To test the feasibility of gene therapy for AIDS patients, an animal model is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach. Antiviral genes (encoding antisense RNA or viral protein) derived from Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were efficiently targeted into CD4+ lymphocytes through retroviral-mediated gene transfer. After challenging with infectious viruses, the transduced lymphocytes that received antiviral genes were not only protected from SIV infection, but also from infection with HIV, for at least 25 days. Furthermore, little or no cytolytic effect (syncytium formation) was observed in the protected cells. These data demonstrated that SIV or HIV replication could be effectively blocked by antisense sequence(s) or negative dominant factors which were introduced into targeted cells through retroviral-mediated gene transfer.",0,"Targeted inhibition of immunodeficiency virus replication in lymphocytes through retroviral mediated gene transfer To test the feasibility of gene therapy for AIDS patients, an animal model is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach.

"Minireview The influence of season, photoperiod, and pineal melatonin on immune function","Abstract: In addition to the well‐documented seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many animal populations. Challenging winter conditions (i.e., low ambient temperature and decreased food availability) can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock. Coping with these challenges can also indirectly increase morbidity and mortality by increasing glucocorticoid secretion, which can compromise immune function. Many environmental challenges are recurrent and thus predictable; animals could enhance survival, and presumably increase fitness, if they could anticipate immunologically challenging conditions in order to cope with these seasonal threats to health. The annual cycle of changing photoperiod provides an accurate indicator of time of year and thus allows immunological adjustments prior to the deterioration of conditions. Pineal melatonin codes day length information. Short day lengths enhance several aspects of immune function in laboratory studies, and melatonin appears to mediate many of the enhanced immunological effects of photoperiod. Generally, field studies report compromised immune function during the short days of autumn and winter. The conflict between laboratory and field data is addressed with a multifactor approach. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic tissue size and structure, as well as immune function and disease processes, is reviewed. The role of pineal melatonin and the hormones regulated by melatonin is discussed from an evolutionary and adaptive functional perspective. Finally, the clinical significance of seasonal fluctuations in immune function is presented. Taken together, it appears that seasonal fluctuations in immune parameters, mediated by melatonin, could have profound effects on the etiology and progression of diseases in humans and nonhuman animals. An adaptive functional perspective is critical to gain insights into the interaction among melatonin, immune function, and disease processes.",0,"Minireview The influence of season, photoperiod, and pineal melatonin on immune function Abstract: In addition to the well‐documented seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many animal populations.

Molecular Epidemiology of Human Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses Highlights Their Diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and enteroviruses (HEVs) belong to the Enterovirus genus and are the most frequent cause of infection worldwide, but data on their molecular epidemiology in Africa are scarce. To understand HRV and HEV molecular epidemiology in this setting, we enrolled febrile pediatric patients participating in a large prospective cohort assessing the causes of fever in Tanzanian children. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were systematically collected and tested by real-time RT-PCR for HRV and HEV. Viruses from positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were then applied to highlight the HRV and HEV types as well as recombinant or divergent strains. Thirty-eight percent (378/1005) of the enrolled children harboured an HRV or HEV infection. Although some types were predominant, many distinct types were co-circulating, including a vaccinal poliovirus, HEV-A71 and HEV-D68. Three HRV-A recombinants were identified: HRV-A36/HRV-A67, HRV-A12/HRV-A67 and HRV-A96/HRV-A61. Four divergent HRV strains were also identified: one HRV-B strain and three HRV-C strains. This is the first prospective study focused on HRV and HEV molecular epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa. This systematic and thorough large screening with careful clinical data management confirms the wide genomic diversity of these viruses, brings new insights about their evolution and provides data about associated symptoms.",0,"Molecular Epidemiology of Human Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses Highlights Their Diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and enteroviruses (HEVs) belong to the Enterovirus genus and are the most frequent cause of infection worldwide, but data on their molecular epidemiology in Africa are scarce.

A cost effective real-time PCR for the detection of adenovirus from viral swabs,"Compared to traditional testing strategies, nucleic acid amplification tests such as real-time PCR offer many advantages for the detection of human adenoviruses. However, commercial assays are expensive and cost prohibitive for many clinical laboratories. To overcome fiscal challenges, a cost effective strategy was developed using a combination of homogenization and heat treatment with an “in-house” real-time PCR. In 196 swabs submitted for adenovirus detection, this crude extraction method showed performance characteristics equivalent to viral DNA obtained from a commercial nucleic acid extraction. In addition, the in-house real-time PCR outperformed traditional testing strategies using virus culture, with sensitivities of 100% and 69.2%, respectively. Overall, the combination of homogenization and heat treatment with a sensitive in-house real-time PCR provides accurate results at a cost comparable to viral culture.",0,"A cost effective real-time PCR for the detection of adenovirus from viral swabs Compared to traditional testing strategies, nucleic acid amplification tests such as real-time PCR offer many advantages for the detection of human adenoviruses.

Establishing the inter-rater reliability of spinal cord damage manual measurement using magnetic resonance imaging,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVES: To establish the inter-rater reliability in the quantitative evaluation of spinal cord damage following cervical incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used to perform manual measurements of the cranial and caudal boundaries of edema, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume in 10 participants with cervical incomplete SCI. SETTING: Academic university setting. METHODS: Structural MRIs of 10 participants with SCI were collected from Northwestern University’s Neuromuscular Imaging and Research Lab. All manual measures were performed using OsiriX (Pixmeo Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine inter-rater reliability across seven raters of varying experience. RESULTS: High-to-excellent inter-rater reliability was found for all measures. ICC values for cranial/caudal levels of involvement, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume were 0.99, 0.98, 0.90, 0.84, and 0.93, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Manual MRI measures of spinal cord damage are reliable between raters. Researchers and clinicians may confidently utilize manual MRI measures to quantify cord damage. Future research to predict functional recovery following SCI and better inform clinical management is warranted.",0,"Establishing the inter-rater reliability of spinal cord damage manual measurement using magnetic resonance imaging STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.

Biomarkers of Infection: Are They Useful in the ICU?,"Biomarkers are increasingly used in patients with serious infections in the critical care setting to complement clinical judgment and interpretation of other diagnostic and prognostic tests. The main purposes of such blood markers are (1) to improve infection diagnosis (i.e., differentiation between bacterial vs. viral vs. fungal vs. noninfectious), (2) to help in the early risk stratification and thus provide prognostic information regarding the risk for mortality and other adverse outcomes, and (3) to optimize antibiotic tailoring to individual needs of patients (“antibiotic stewardship”). Especially in critically ill patients, in whom sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, rapid diagnosis is desirable to start timely and specific treatment. Besides some biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, which is well established and has shown positive effects in regard to utilization of antimicrobials and clinical outcomes, there is a growing number of novel markers from different pathophysiological pathways, where the final proof of an added value to clinical judgment and ultimately clinical benefit to patients is still lacking. Without a doubt, the addition of blood biomarkers to clinical medicine has had a strong impact on the way we care for patients today. Recent trials show that as an adjunct to other clinical and laboratory parameters these markers provide important information about risks for bacterial infection and resolution of infection. Moreover, biomarkers can help to optimize management of patients with serious illness in the intensive care unit, thereby offering more individualized treatment courses with overall improvements in clinical outcomes.",0,"Biomarkers of Infection: Are They Useful in the ICU?

Oral Immunization of Chickens With Recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum Vaccine Against Early ALV-J Infection,"In this study, a novel oral vaccine of recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) containing the gp85 protein was explored, and the effects of this vaccine on the prevention of subgroup J Avian Leukosis Virus (ALV-J) infection were assessed. In the current study, the gp85 protein of ALV-J was expressed on the surface of L. plantarum with the surface-display motif, pgsA, by constructing a shuttle vector pMG36e:pgsA:gp85. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by western blotting and flow cytometry. Subsequently, Specific Pathogen Free Hy-Line Brown layer chickens were orally vaccinated with the recombinant L. plantarum and presented with high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) titers in bile and duodenal-mucosal fluid. After challenged with ALV-J of a 3 × 10(3) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), serum samples of the chickens were collected and viremia was analyzed. Results showed that, compared to the L. plantarum and PBS control group, the recombinant L. plantarum group showed a significant rise in antibody levels after inoculation, and provide improved protection against ALV-J according to viremia detection.

Limiting infections and providing patients with optimal drug regimens require timely strain identification as well as virulence and drug-resistance profiling. Additionally, prophylactic interventions based on the identification of environmental sources of recurrent infections (e.g., contaminated sinks) and reconstruction of transmission chains (i.e., who infected whom) could help to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections. WGS could hold the key to solving these issues. However, uptake in the clinic has been slow. Some major scientific and logistical challenges need to be solved before WGS fulfils its potential in clinical microbial diagnostics.

Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: Viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein,"Structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response. Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class 11 binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class 11 binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",0,"Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: Viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein Structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response.

ICU-acquired weakness,"Critically ill patients often acquire neuropathy and/or myopathy labeled ICU-acquired weakness. The current insights into incidence, pathophysiology, diagnostic tools, risk factors, short- and long-term consequences and management of ICU-acquired weakness are narratively reviewed. PubMed was searched for combinations of “neuropathy”, “myopathy”, “neuromyopathy”, or “weakness” with “critical illness”, “critically ill”, “ICU”, “PICU”, “sepsis” or “burn”. ICU-acquired weakness affects limb and respiratory muscles with a widely varying prevalence depending on the study population. Pathophysiology remains incompletely understood but comprises complex structural/functional alterations within myofibers and neurons.

Urbanisation and human health in China: spatial features and a systemic perspective,"BACKGROUND, AIMS AND SCOPE: Current studies have paid little attention to the dynamism in urban spatial expansion and its possible environmental and health effects or to the health effects of rapid urban environmental change at different points along the urbanisation gradient. This study adopts a public health ecology approach to systematically understand the relationship between urbanisation, urban environmental change and human health in China. METHOD: Remote sensing image analysis, based on night light data at five different time periods in recent decades, was used to determine changes to the overall urban area. Through a review of the evidence on the relationships between environmental health, urbanisation and health, we advance a pathway framework for explaining urban human health ecology. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation between disease prevalence and urbanisation level, adding a further dimension to a systemic understanding of urban health. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Urban areas have been increasing spatially, but unevenly, in recent decades, with medium and small cities also expanding rapidly in the past decade. Urbanisation and urban expansion result in changes to land use/coverage change, the urban environment and the residents’ lifestyle, which result in human health problems. Regions with the highest urbanisation level were more inclined to have a high prevalence of chronic disease in recent decades. An ecological public health approach provides insights into the multiple types of data which need to be routinely collected if human disease is not to become a barrier to social and economic development.",0,"Urbanisation and human health in China: spatial features and a systemic perspective BACKGROUND, AIMS AND SCOPE: Current studies have paid little attention to the dynamism in urban spatial expansion and its possible environmental and health effects or to the health effects of rapid urban environmental change at different points along the urbanisation gradient.

Evaluating Behavioral and Linguistic Changes During Drug Treatment for Depression Using Tweets in Spanish: Pairwise Comparison Study,"BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are the most common mental illnesses, and they constitute the leading cause of disability worldwide. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of depressive disorders. Some people share information about their experiences with antidepressants on social media platforms such as Twitter. Analysis of the messages posted by Twitter users under SSRI treatment can yield useful information on how these antidepressants affect users’ behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the behavioral and linguistic characteristics of the tweets posted while users were likely to be under SSRI treatment, in comparison to the tweets posted by the same users when they were less likely to be taking this medication. METHODS: In the first step, the timelines of Twitter users mentioning SSRI antidepressants in their tweets were selected using a list of 128 generic and brand names of SSRIs. In the second step, two datasets of tweets were created, the in-treatment dataset (made up of the tweets posted throughout the 30 days after mentioning an SSRI) and the unknown-treatment dataset (made up of tweets posted more than 90 days before or more than 90 days after any tweet mentioning an SSRI). For each user, the changes in behavioral and linguistic features between the tweets classified in these two datasets were analyzed. 186 users and their timelines with 668,842 tweets were finally included in the study. RESULTS: The number of tweets generated per day by the users when they were in treatment was higher than it was when they were in the unknown-treatment period (P=.001). When the users were in treatment, the mean percentage of tweets posted during the daytime (from 8 AM to midnight) increased in comparison to the unknown-treatment period (P=.002). The number of characters and words per tweet was higher when the users were in treatment (P=.03 and P=.02, respectively). Regarding linguistic features, the percentage of pronouns that were first-person singular was higher when users were in treatment (P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and linguistic changes have been detected when users with depression are taking antidepressant medication. These features can provide interesting insights for monitoring the evolution of this disease, as well as offering additional information related to treatment adherence. This information may be especially useful in patients who are receiving long-term treatments such as people suffering from depression.",0,"Evaluating Behavioral and Linguistic Changes During Drug Treatment for Depression Using Tweets in Spanish: Pairwise Comparison Study BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are the most common mental illnesses, and they constitute the leading cause of disability worldwide.

Multi-Block Color-Binarized Statistical Images for Single-Sample Face Recognition,"Single-Sample Face Recognition (SSFR) is a computer vision challenge. In this scenario, there is only one example from each individual on which to train the system, making it difficult to identify persons in unconstrained environments, mainly when dealing with changes in facial expression, posture, lighting, and occlusion. This paper discusses the relevance of an original method for SSFR, called Multi-Block Color-Binarized Statistical Image Features (MB-C-BSIF), which exploits several kinds of features, namely, local, regional, global, and textured-color characteristics. First, the MB-C-BSIF method decomposes a facial image into three channels (e.g., red, green, and blue), then it divides each channel into equal non-overlapping blocks to select the local facial characteristics that are consequently employed in the classification phase. Finally, the identity is determined by calculating the similarities among the characteristic vectors adopting a distance measurement of the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier. Extensive experiments on several subsets of the unconstrained Alex and Robert (AR) and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases show that the MB-C-BSIF achieves superior and competitive results in unconstrained situations when compared to current state-of-the-art methods, especially when dealing with changes in facial expression, lighting, and occlusion. The average classification accuracies are 96.17% and 99% for the AR database with two specific protocols (i.e., Protocols I and II, respectively), and 38.01% for the challenging LFW database. These performances are clearly superior to those obtained by state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method uses algorithms based only on simple and elementary image processing operations that do not imply higher computational costs as in holistic, sparse or deep learning methods, making it ideal for real-time identification.",0,"Multi-Block Color-Binarized Statistical Images for Single-Sample Face Recognition Single-Sample Face Recognition (SSFR) is a computer vision challenge.

Suitability of Text-Based Communications for the Delivery of Psychological Therapeutic Services to Rural and Remote Communities: Scoping Review,"BACKGROUND: People living in rural and remote areas have poorer access to mental health services than those living in cities. They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020. RESULTS: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment. Such approaches have implications for policy development to improve intervention accessibility in at-risk and underserved populations.",0,"Suitability of Text-Based Communications for the Delivery of Psychological Therapeutic Services to Rural and Remote Communities: Scoping Review BACKGROUND: People living in rural and remote areas have poorer access to mental health services than those living in cities.

The effects of flooding and weather conditions on leptospirosis transmission in Thailand,"The epidemic of leptospirosis in humans occurs annually in Thailand. In this study, we have developed mathematical models to investigate transmission dynamics between humans, animals, and a contaminated environment. We compared different leptospire transmission models involving flooding and weather conditions, shedding and multiplication rate in a contaminated environment. We found that the model in which the transmission rate depends on both flooding and temperature, best-fits the reported human data on leptospirosis in Thailand. Our results indicate that flooding strongly contributes to disease transmission, where a high degree of flooding leads to a higher number of infected individuals. Sensitivity analysis showed that the transmission rate of leptospires from a contaminated environment was the most important parameter for the total number of human cases. Our results suggest that public education should target people who work in contaminated environments to prevent Leptospira infections.",0,"The effects of flooding and weather conditions on leptospirosis transmission in Thailand The epidemic of leptospirosis in humans occurs annually in Thailand.

Is boosting the immune system in sepsis appropriate?,"A relative immunosuppression is observed in patients after sepsis, trauma, burns, or any severe insults. It is currently proposed that selected patients will benefit from treatment aimed at boosting their immune systems. However, the host immune response needs to be considered in context with pathogen-type, timing, and mainly tissue specificity. Indeed, the immune status of leukocytes is not universally decreased and their activated status in tissues contributes to organ failure. Accordingly, any new immune-stimulatory therapeutic intervention should take into consideration potentially deleterious effects in some situations.",0,"Is boosting the immune system in sepsis appropriate?

A rational approach to selective pharmacophore designing: an innovative strategy for specific recognition of Gsk3β,"We propose a novel cheminformatics approach that combines structure and ligand-based design to identify target-specific pharmacophores with well-defined exclusion ability. Our strategy includes the prediction of selective interactions, developing structure, and knowledge-based selective pharmacophore models, followed by database screening and molecular docking. This unique strategy was employed in addressing the off-target toxicity of Gsk3β and CDKs. The connections of Gsk3β in eukaryotic cell apoptosis and the extensive potency of Gsk3β inhibitors to block cell death have made it a potential drug-discovery target for many grievous human disorders. Gsk3β is phylogenetically very closely related to the CDKs, such as CDK1 and CDK2, which are suggested to be the off-target proteins of Gsk3β inhibitors. Here, we have employed novel computational approaches in designing the ligand candidates that are potentially inhibitory against Gsk3β, with well-defined the exclusion ability to CDKs. A structure-ligand -based selective pharmacophore was modeled. This model was used to retrieve molecules from the zinc database. The hits retrieved were further screened by molecular docking and protein–ligand interaction fingerprints. Based on these results, four molecules were predicted as selective Gsk3β antagonists.

This unique strategy was employed in addressing the off-target toxicity of Gsk3β and CDKs. The connections of Gsk3β in eukaryotic cell apoptosis and the extensive potency of Gsk3β inhibitors to block cell death have made it a potential drug-discovery target for many grievous human disorders. Gsk3β is phylogenetically very closely related to the CDKs, such as CDK1 and CDK2, which are suggested to be the off-target proteins of Gsk3β inhibitors. Here, we have employed novel computational approaches in designing the ligand candidates that are potentially inhibitory against Gsk3β, with well-defined the exclusion ability to CDKs. A structure-ligand -based selective pharmacophore was modeled. This model was used to retrieve molecules from the zinc database. The hits retrieved were further screened by molecular docking and protein–ligand interaction fingerprints. Based on these results, four molecules were predicted as selective Gsk3β antagonists.

"Human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural coastal Kenya, 2015-2016, observed through outpatient surveillance","Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the predominant cause of upper respiratory tract infections, resulting in a significant public health burden. The virus circulates as many different types (168), each generating strong homologous, but weak heterotypic, immunity. The influence of these features on transmission patterns of HRV in the community is understudied. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at nine out-patient facilities across a Health and Demographic Surveillance System between December 2015 and November 2016. HRV was diagnosed by real-time RT-PCR, and the VP4/VP2 genomic region of the positive samples sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the HRV types. Classification models and G-test statistic were used to investigate HRV type spatial distribution. Demographic characteristics and clinical features of ARI were also compared. Results: Of 5,744 NPS samples collected, HRV was detected in 1057 (18.4%), of which 817 (77.3%) were successfully sequenced. HRV species A, B and C were identified in 360 (44.1%), 67 (8.2%) and 390 (47.7%) samples, respectively. In total, 87 types were determined: 39, 10 and 38 occurred within species A, B and C, respectively. HRV types presented heterogeneous temporal patterns of persistence. Spatially, identical types occurred over a wide distance at similar times, but there was statistically significant evidence for clustering of types between health facilities in close proximity or linked by major road networks. Conclusion: This study records a high prevalence of HRV in out-patient presentations exhibiting high type diversity. Patterns of occurrence suggest frequent and independent community invasion of different types. Temporal differences of persistence between types may reflect variation in type-specific population immunity. Spatial patterns suggest either rapid spread or multiple invasions of the same type, but evidence of similar types amongst close health facilities, or along road systems, indicate type partitioning structured by local spread.",0,"Human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural coastal Kenya, 2015-2016, observed through outpatient surveillance Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the predominant cause of upper respiratory tract infections, resulting in a significant public health burden.

Oligonucleotide Functionalised Microbeads: Indispensable Tools for High-Throughput Aptamer Selection,"The functionalisation of microbeads with oligonucleotides has become an indispensable technique for high-throughput aptamer selection in SELEX protocols. In addition to simplifying the separation of binding and non-binding aptamer candidates, microbeads have facilitated the integration of other technologies such as emulsion PCR (ePCR) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to high-throughput selection techniques. Within these systems, monoclonal aptamer microbeads can be individually generated and assayed to assess aptamer candidate fitness thereby helping eliminate stochastic effects which are common to classical SELEX techniques. Such techniques have given rise to aptamers with 1000 times greater binding affinities when compared to traditional SELEX. Another emerging technique is Fluorescence Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) whereby selection does not rely on binding capture allowing evolution of a greater diversity of aptamer properties such as fluorescence or enzymatic activity. Within this review we explore examples and applications of oligonucleotide functionalised microbeads in aptamer selection and reflect upon new opportunities arising for aptamer science.",0,"Oligonucleotide Functionalised Microbeads: Indispensable Tools for High-Throughput Aptamer Selection The functionalisation of microbeads with oligonucleotides has become an indispensable technique for high-throughput aptamer selection in SELEX protocols.

Diagnostics for Lassa fever virus: a genetically diverse pathogen found in low-resource settings,"Lassa fever virus (LASV) causes acute viral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms similar to those seen with Ebola virus infections. LASV is endemic to West Africa and is transmitted through contact with excretions of infected Mastomys natalensis rodents and other rodent species. Due to a high fatality rate, lack of treatment options and difficulties with prevention and control, LASV is one of the high-priority pathogens included in the WHO R&D Blueprint. The WHO LASV vaccine strategy relies on availability of effective diagnostic tests. Current diagnostics for LASV include in-house and commercial (primarily research-only) laboratory-based serological and nucleic acid amplification tests. There are two commercially available (for research use only) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and a number of multiplex panels for differential detection of LASV infection from other endemic diseases with similar symptoms have been evaluated. However, a number of diagnostic gaps remain. Lineage detection is a challenge due to the genomic diversity of LASV, as pan-lineage sensitivity for both molecular and immunological detection is necessary for surveillance and outbreak response. While pan-lineage ELISA and RDTs are commercially available (for research use only), validation and external quality assessment (EQA) is needed to confirm detection sensitivity for all known or relevant strains. Variable sensitivity of LASV PCR tests also highlights the need for improved validation and EQA. Given that LASV outbreaks typically occur in low-resource settings, more options for point-of-care testing would be valuable. These requirements should be taken into account in target product profiles for improved LASV diagnostics.",0,"Diagnostics for Lassa fever virus: a genetically diverse pathogen found in low-resource settings Lassa fever virus (LASV) causes acute viral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms similar to those seen with Ebola virus infections.

"Antibacterial activity of iron oxide, iron nitride, and tobramycin conjugated nanoparticles against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms","BACKGROUND: Novel methods are necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients suffering from infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Being the most common infectious species of the Pseudomonas genus, P. aeruginosa is the primary Gram-negative etiology responsible for nosocomial infections. Due to the ubiquity and high adaptability of this species, an effective universal treatment method for P. aeruginosa infection still eludes investigators, despite the extensive research in this area. RESULTS: We report bacterial inhibition by iron-oxide (nominally magnetite) nanoparticles (NPs) alone, having a mean hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 16 nm, as well as alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs. Alginate capping increased the average hydrodynamic diameter to ~ 230 nm. We also investigated alginate-capped iron-oxide NP-drug conjugates, with a practically unchanged hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 232 nm. Susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the NPs, NP-tobramycin conjugates, and tobramycin alone were determined in the PAO1 bacterial colonies. Investigations into susceptibility using the disk diffusion method were done after 3 days of biofilm growth and after 60 days of growth. MIC of all compounds of interest was determined after 60-days of growth, to ensure thorough establishment of biofilm colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Positive inhibition is reported for uncapped and alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs, and the corresponding MICs are presented. We report zero susceptibility to iron-oxide NPs capped with polyethylene glycol, suggesting that the capping agent plays a major role in enabling bactericidal ability in of the nanocomposite. Our findings suggest that the alginate-coated nanocomposites investigated in this study have the potential to overcome the bacterial biofilm barrier. Magnetic field application increases the action, likely via enhanced diffusion of the iron-oxide NPs and NP-drug conjugates through mucin and alginate barriers, which are characteristic of cystic-fibrosis respiratory infections. We demonstrate that iron-oxide NPs coated with alginate, as well as alginate-coated magnetite–tobramycin conjugates inhibit P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation in established colonies. We have also determined that susceptibility to tobramycin decreases for longer culture times. However, susceptibility to the iron-oxide NP compounds did not demonstrate any comparable decrease with increasing culture time. These findings imply that iron-oxide NPs are promising lower-cost alternatives to silver NPs in antibacterial coatings, solutions, and drugs, as well as other applications in which microbial abolition or infestation prevention is sought.",0,"Antibacterial activity of iron oxide, iron nitride, and tobramycin conjugated nanoparticles against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms BACKGROUND: Novel methods are necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients suffering from infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Multiple probabilistic traveling salesman problem in the coordination of drug transportation—In the context of sustainability goals and Industry 4.0,"Improving the effectiveness of route planning, especially in road transport deliveries is a challenge we need to face in the context of advancing climate change and the sustainable development goals. The main aim of the paper is to demonstrate the above average and utilitarian significance of the multiple probabilistic traveling salesman problem (MPTSP) in the coordination and modeling of sustainable product transportation, which is a novelty at the theoretical, conceptual, methodological and empirical level. We propose a new, hybrid algorithm of solving MPTSP instances (it connects harmony search, k-means and 2-opt), which can be successfully used in economic practice for coordination and modeling of Industry 4.0. The effectiveness of proposed approach is tested using a case study of drugs distribution services and datasets obtained from the transportation enterprise located in Poland. The study focuses on the issue of planning routes, with particular emphasis on the changing demand of customers. It should be stressed that this work may be of interest to researchers but also to management practitioners.

Mining Candidate Viruses as Potential Bio-terrorism Weapons from Biomedical Literature,"In this paper we present a semantic-based data mining approach to identify candidate viruses as potential bio-terrorism weapons from biomedical literature. We first identify all the possible properties of viruses as search key words based on Geissler’s 13 criteria; the identified properties are then defined using MeSH terms. Then, we assign each property an importance weight based on domain experts’ judgment. After generating all the possible valid combinations of the properties, we search the biomedical literature, retrieving all the relevant documents. Next our method extracts virus names from the downloaded documents for each search keyword and identifies the novel connection of the virus according to these 4 properties. If a virus is found in the different document sets obtained by several search keywords, the virus should be considered as suspicious and treated as candidate viruses for bio-terrorism. Our findings are intended as a guide to the virus literature to support further studies that might then lead to appropriate defense and public health measures.",0,"Mining Candidate Viruses as Potential Bio-terrorism Weapons from Biomedical Literature In this paper we present a semantic-based data mining approach to identify candidate viruses as potential bio-terrorism weapons from biomedical literature.

Food Innovation Adoption and Organic Food Consumerism—A Cross National Study between Malaysia and Hungary,"In order to meet the rising global demand for food and to ensure food security in line with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 2, technological advances have been introduced in the food production industry. The organic food industry has benefitted from advances in food technology and innovation. However, there remains skepticism regarding organic foods on the part of consumers, specifically on consumers’ acceptance of food innovation technologies used in the production of organic foods. This study measured factors that influence consumers’ food innovation adoption and subsequently their intention to purchase organic foods. We compared the organic foods purchase behavior of Malaysian and Hungarian consumers to examine differences between Asian and European consumers. The findings show food innovation adoption as the most crucial predictor for the intention to purchase organic foods in Hungary, while social lifestyle factor was the most influential in Malaysia. Other factors such as environmental concerns and health consciousness were also examined in relation to food innovation adoption and organic food consumerism.

Expansion of RiPP biosynthetic space through integration of pan-genomics and machine learning uncovers a novel class of lanthipeptides,"Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 Streptomyces genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.",0,"Expansion of RiPP biosynthetic space through integration of pan-genomics and machine learning uncovers a novel class of lanthipeptides Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes.

We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 Streptomyces genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.",expansion of ripp biosynthetic space through integration of pangenomics and machine learning uncovers a novel class of lanthipeptides microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds many which can have antibiotic antiviral or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes natural product classes include polyketides pks nonribosomal peptides nrps and ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides ripps while variants of biosynthetic gene clusters bgcs for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences bgcs for new compound classes escape attention in particular evidence is accumulating that for ripps subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg here we present decrippter datadriven exploratory classindependent ripp tracker a ripp genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel ripp classes decrippter combines a support vector machine svm that identifies candidate ripp precursors with pangenomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operonlike structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus subsequently it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species we then applied decrippter to mine 1295 streptomyces genomes which led to the identification of 42 new candidate ripp families that could not be found by existing programs one of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides which we designate class v the 2d structure of the new ripp which we name pristinin a3 1 was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr tandem mass spectrometry msms data and chemical labeling two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges taken together our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria,1

Overview of Virus Metagenomic Classification Methods and Their Biological Applications,"Metagenomics poses opportunities for clinical and public health virology applications by offering a way to assess complete taxonomic composition of a clinical sample in an unbiased way. However, the techniques required are complicated and analysis standards have yet to develop. This, together with the wealth of different tools and workflows that have been proposed, poses a barrier for new users. We evaluated 49 published computational classification workflows for virus metagenomics in a literature review. To this end, we described the methods of existing workflows by breaking them up into five general steps and assessed their ease-of-use and validation experiments. Performance scores of previous benchmarks were summarized and correlations between methods and performance were investigated. We indicate the potential suitability of the different workflows for (1) time-constrained diagnostics, (2) surveillance and outbreak source tracing, (3) detection of remote homologies (discovery), and (4) biodiversity studies. We provide two decision trees for virologists to help select a workflow for medical or biodiversity studies, as well as directions for future developments in clinical viral metagenomics.",0,"Overview of Virus Metagenomic Classification Methods and Their Biological Applications Metagenomics poses opportunities for clinical and public health virology applications by offering a way to assess complete taxonomic composition of a clinical sample in an unbiased way.

FluA-p score: a novel prediction rule for mortality in influenza A-related pneumonia patients,"BACKGROUND: The pneumonia severity index (PSI) and the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age ≥ 65 years) score have been shown to predict mortality in community-acquired pneumonia. Their ability to predict influenza-related pneumonia, however, is less well-established. METHODS: A total of 693 laboratory-confirmed FluA-p patients diagnosed between Jan 2013 and Dec 2018 and recruited from five teaching hospitals in China were included in the study. The sample included 494 patients in the derivation cohort and 199 patients in the validation cohort. The prediction rule was established based on independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients from the derivation cohort. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality of FluA-p patients was 19.6% (136/693). The FluA-p score was based on a multivariate logistic regression model designed to predict mortality. Results indicated the following significant predictors (regression statistics and point contributions toward total score in parentheses): blood urea nitrogen > 7 mmol/L (OR 1.604, 95% CI 1.150–4.492, p = 0.040; 1 points), pO(2)/F(i)O(2) ≤ 250 mmHg (OR 2.649, 95% CI 1.103–5.142, p = 0.022; 2 points), cardiovascular disease (OR 3.967, 95% CI 1.269–7.322, p < 0.001; 3 points), arterial PH < 7.35 (OR 3.959, 95% CI 1.393–7.332, p < 0.001; 3 points), smoking history (OR 5.176, 95% CI 2.604–11.838, p = 0.001; 4 points), lymphocytes < 0.8 × 10(9)/L (OR 8.391, 95% CI 3.271–16.212, p < 0.001; 5 points), and early neurominidase inhibitor therapy (OR 0.567, 95% CI 0.202–0.833, p = 0.005; − 2 points). Seven points was used as the cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. The model showed a sensitivity of 0.941, a specificity of 0.762, and overall better predictive performance than the PSI risk class (AUROC = 0.908 vs 0.560, p < 0.001) and the CURB-65 score (AUROC = 0.908 vs 0.777, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that a FluA-p score was easy to derive and that it served as a reliable prediction rule for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients. The score could also effectively stratify FluA-p patients into relevant risk categories and thereby help treatment providers to make more rational clinical decisions.",0,"FluA-p score: a novel prediction rule for mortality in influenza A-related pneumonia patients BACKGROUND: The pneumonia severity index (PSI) and the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age ≥ 65 years) score have been shown to predict mortality in community-acquired pneumonia.

Peptide-Based Vaccines: Current Progress and Future Challenges,"[Image: see text] Vaccines have had a profound impact on the management and prevention of infectious disease. In addition, the development of vaccines against chronic diseases has attracted considerable interest as an approach to prevent, rather than treat, conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and others. Subunit vaccines consist of nongenetic components of the infectious agent or disease-related epitope. In this Review, we discuss peptide-based vaccines and their potential in three therapeutic areas: infectious disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. We discuss factors that contribute to vaccine efficacy and how these parameters may potentially be modulated by design. We examine both clinically tested vaccines as well as nascent approaches and explore current challenges and potential remedies. While peptide vaccines hold substantial promise in the prevention of human disease, many obstacles remain that have hampered their clinical use; thus, continued research efforts to address these challenges are warranted.",0,"Peptide-Based Vaccines: Current Progress and Future Challenges [Image: see text] Vaccines have had a profound impact on the management and prevention of infectious disease.

Salmonella enterica Serovars Enteritidis Infection Alters the Indigenous Microbiota Diversity in Young Layer Chicks,"Avian gastrointestinal (GI) tracts are highly populated with a diverse array of microorganisms that share a symbiotic relationship with their hosts and contribute to the overall health and disease state of the intestinal tract. The microbiome of the young chick is easily prone to alteration in its composition by both exogenous and endogenous factors, especially during the early posthatch period. The genetic background of the host and exposure to pathogens can impact the diversity of the microbial profile that consequently contributes to the disease progression in the host. The objective of this study was to profile the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in young chickens from two genetically distinct highly inbred lines. Furthermore, the effect of the Salmonella Enteritidis infection on altering the composition makeup of the chicken microbiome was evaluated through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. One-day-old layer chicks were challenged with S. Enteritidis and the host cecal microbiota profile as well as the degree of susceptibility to Salmonella infection was examined at 2 and 7 days post infection. Our result indicated that host genotype had a limited effect on resistance to S. Enteritidis infection. Alpha diversity, beta diversity, and overall microbiota composition were analyzed for four factors: host genotype, age, treatment, and postinfection time points. S. Enteritidis infection in young chicks was found to significantly reduce the overall diversity of the microbiota population with expansion of Enterobacteriaceae family. These changes indicated that Salmonella colonization in the GI tract of the chickens has a direct effect on altering the natural development of the GI microbiota. The impact of S. Enteritidis infection on microbial communities was also more substantial in the late stage of infection. Significant inverse correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae family in both non-infected and infected groups, suggested possible antagonistic interaction between members of these two taxa, which could potentially influences the overall microbial population in the gut. Our results also revealed that genetic difference between two lines had minimal effect on the establishment of microbiota population. Overall, this study provided preliminary insights into the contributing role of S.

Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila,"Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution. As a result, Drosophila can be used to deconstruct many of the key events in host-pathogen interactions by using a wealth of well-developed molecular and genetic tools. In this review, we aim to emphasize the great leverage provided by the suite of genomic and classical genetic approaches available in flies for decoding details of host-pathogen interactions; these findings can then be applied to studies in higher organisms. We first briefly summarize the general strategies by which Drosophila resists and responds to pathogens. We then focus on how recently developed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens conducted in cells and flies, combined with classical genetic methods, have provided molecular insight into host-pathogen interactions, covering examples of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Finally, we discuss novel strategies for how flies can be used as a tool to examine how specific isolated virulence factors act on an intact host.",0,"Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution.

"Closely related reovirus lab strains induce opposite expression of RIG-I/IFN-dependent versus -independent host genes, via mechanisms of slow replication versus polymorphisms in dsRNA binding σ3 respectively","The Dearing isolate of Mammalian orthoreovirus (T3D) is a prominent model of virus-host relationships and a candidate oncolytic virotherapy. Closely related laboratory strains of T3D, originating from the same ancestral T3D isolate, were recently found to exhibit significantly different oncolytic properties. Specifically, the T3D(PL) strain had faster replication kinetics in a panel of cancer cells and improved tumor regression in an in vivo melanoma model, relative to T3D(TD). In this study, we discover that T3D(PL) and T3D(TD) also differentially activate host signalling pathways and downstream gene transcription. At equivalent infectious dose, T3D(TD) induces higher IRF3 phosphorylation and expression of type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) than T3D(PL). Using mono-reassortants with intermediate replication kinetics and pharmacological inhibitors of reovirus replication, IFN responses were found to inversely correlate with kinetics of virus replication. In other words, slow-replicating T3D strains induce more IFN signalling than fast-replicating T3D strains. Paradoxically, during co-infections by T3D(PL) and T3D(TD), there was still high IRF3 phosphorylation indicating a phenodominant effect by the slow-replicating T3D(TD). Using silencing and knock-out of RIG-I to impede IFN, we found that IFN induction does not affect the first round of reovirus replication but does prevent cell-cell spread in a paracrine fashion. Accordingly, during co-infections, T3D(PL) continues to replicate robustly despite activation of IFN by T3D(TD). Using gene expression analysis, we discovered that reovirus can also induce a subset of genes in a RIG-I and IFN-independent manner; these genes were induced more by T3D(PL) than T3D(TD). Polymorphisms in reovirus σ3 viral protein were found to control activation of RIG-I/ IFN-independent genes. Altogether, the study reveals that single amino acid polymorphisms in reovirus genomes can have large impact on host gene expression, by both changing replication kinetics and by modifying viral protein activity, such that two closely related T3D strains can induce opposite cytokine landscapes.",0,"Closely related reovirus lab strains induce opposite expression of RIG-I/IFN-dependent versus -independent host genes, via mechanisms of slow replication versus polymorphisms in dsRNA binding σ3 respectively The Dearing isolate of Mammalian orthoreovirus (T3D) is a prominent model of virus-host relationships and a candidate oncolytic virotherapy.

Comparing MOPV and LASV is a powerful strategy to unravel pathogenic mechanisms that occur during the course of pathogenic arenavirus infection. We used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify cell partners of MOPV and LASV Z matrix protein in which two autophagy adaptors were identified, NDP52 and TAX1BP1. Autophagy has emerged as an important cellular defense mechanism against viral infections but its role during arenavirus infection has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is transiently induced by MOPV, but not LASV, in infected cells two days after infection. Impairment of the early steps of autophagy significantly decreased the production of MOPV and LASV infectious particles, whereas a blockade of the degradative steps impaired only MOPV infectious particle production. Our study provides insights into the role played by autophagy during MOPV and LASV infection and suggests that this process could partially explain their different pathogenicity.",0,"Autophagy Promotes Infectious Particle Production of Mopeia and Lassa Viruses Lassa virus (LASV) and Mopeia virus (MOPV) are two closely related Old-World mammarenaviruses.

Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States: 1999–2018,"Low intakes of fruits and vegetables have resulted in suboptimal intakes of several micronutrients, including vitamin C. This cross-sectional study used data from 84,902 children/adults (≥1 y) who completed a 24-h dietary recall as part of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2018). Mean vitamin C intakes from foods/beverages were calculated as were trends in major food/beverage sources of vitamin C. Percentages below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) were estimated. Overall, mean vitamin C consumption declined by 23% (97–75 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). 100% fruit juice was the leading source of vitamin C (25.6% of total or 21.7mg/d), but this declined by 48% (25–13 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001). Whole fruit increased among children/adolescents (+75.8%;10–17 mg/d; p-value for trend < 0.001), but not adults, while the vegetable contribution was generally unchanged. The proportion of the population below the EAR increased by 23.8% on a relative scale or 9 percentage points on an absolute scale (38.3–47.4%). Declines in vitamin C intake is driven largely by decreases in fruit juice coupled with modest increases in whole fruit. Due to associations between vitamin C intake and numerous health outcomes these trends warrant careful monitoring moving forward.",0,"Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States: 1999–2018 Low intakes of fruits and vegetables have resulted in suboptimal intakes of several micronutrients, including vitamin C.

Reverse C-glycosidase reaction provides C-nucleotide building blocks of xenobiotic nucleic acids,"C-Analogues of the canonical N-nucleosides have considerable importance in medicinal chemistry and are promising building blocks of xenobiotic nucleic acids (XNA) in synthetic biology. Although well established for synthesis of N-nucleosides, biocatalytic methods are lacking in C-nucleoside synthetic chemistry. Here, we identify pseudouridine monophosphate C-glycosidase for selective 5-β-C-glycosylation of uracil and derivatives thereof from pentose 5-phosphate (d-ribose, 2-deoxy-d-ribose, d-arabinose, d-xylose) substrates. Substrate requirements of the enzymatic reaction are consistent with a Mannich-like addition between the pyrimidine nucleobase and the iminium intermediate of enzyme (Lys166) and open-chain pentose 5-phosphate. β-Elimination of the lysine and stereoselective ring closure give the product. We demonstrate phosphorylation-glycosylation cascade reactions for efficient, one-pot synthesis of C-nucleoside phosphates (yield: 33 – 94%) from unprotected sugar and nucleobase. We show incorporation of the enzymatically synthesized C-nucleotide triphosphates into nucleic acids by RNA polymerase. Collectively, these findings implement biocatalytic methodology for C-nucleotide synthesis which can facilitate XNA engineering for synthetic biology applications.",0,"Reverse C-glycosidase reaction provides C-nucleotide building blocks of xenobiotic nucleic acids C-Analogues of the canonical N-nucleosides have considerable importance in medicinal chemistry and are promising building blocks of xenobiotic nucleic acids (XNA) in synthetic biology.

Inhibition of Human Cathepsins B and L by Caffeic Acid and Its Derivatives,"Caffeic acid (CA) and its derivatives caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) are phenolic compounds of plant origin with a wide range of biological activities. Here, we identify and characterize their inhibitory properties against human cathepsins B and L, potent, ubiquitously expressed cysteine peptidases involved in protein turnover and homeostasis, as well as pathological conditions, such as cancer. We show that CAPE and CGA inhibit both peptidases, while CA shows a preference for cathepsin B, resulting in the strongest inhibition among these combinations. All compounds are linear (complete) inhibitors acting via mixed or catalytic mechanisms. Cathepsin B is more strongly inhibited at pH 7.4 than at 5.5, and CA inhibits its endopeptidase activity preferentially over its peptidyl-dipeptidase activity. Altogether, the results identify the CA scaffold as a promising candidate for the development of cathepsin B inhibitors, specifically targeting its endopeptidase activity associated with pathological proteolysis of extracellular substrates.",0,"Inhibition of Human Cathepsins B and L by Caffeic Acid and Its Derivatives Caffeic acid (CA) and its derivatives caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) are phenolic compounds of plant origin with a wide range of biological activities.

Protective Immunity to Listeria Monocytogenes Infection Mediated by Recombinant Listeria innocua Harboring the VGC Locus,"In this study we propose a novel bacterial vaccine strategy where non-pathogenic bacteria are complemented with traits desirable for the induction of protective immunity. To illustrate the proof of principle of this novel vaccination strategy, we use the model organism of intracellular immunity Listeria. We introduced a, low copy number BAC-plasmid harbouring the virulence gene cluster (vgc) of L. monocytogenes (Lm) into the non-pathogenic L. innocua (L.inn) strain and examined for its ability to induce protective cellular immunity. The resulting strain (L.inn::vgc) was attenuated for virulence in vivo and showed a strongly reduced host detrimental inflammatory response compared to Lm. Like Lm, L.inn::vgc induced the production of Type I Interferon's and protection was mediated by Listeria-specific CD8(+) T cells. Rational vaccine design whereby avirulent strains are equipped with the capabilities to induce protection but lack detrimental inflammatory effects offer great promise towards future studies using non-pathogenic bacteria as vectors for vaccination.",0,"Protective Immunity to Listeria Monocytogenes Infection Mediated by Recombinant Listeria innocua Harboring the VGC Locus In this study we propose a novel bacterial vaccine strategy where non-pathogenic bacteria are complemented with traits desirable for the induction of protective immunity.

LEAP Motion Technology and Psychology: A Mini-Review on Hand Movements Sensing for Neurodevelopmental and Neurocognitive Disorders,"Technological advancement is constantly evolving, and it is also developing in the mental health field. Various applications, often based on virtual reality, have been implemented to carry out psychological assessments and interventions, using innovative human–machine interaction systems. In this context, the LEAP Motion sensing technology has raised interest, since it allows for more natural interactions with digital contents, via an optical tracking of hand and finger movements. Recent research has considered LEAP Motion features in virtual-reality-based systems, to meet specific needs of different clinical populations, varying in age and type of disorder. The present paper carried out a systematic mini-review of the available literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were (i) publication date between 2013 and 2020, (ii) being an empirical study or project report, (iii) written in English or Italian languages, (iv) published in a scholarly peer-reviewed journal and/or conference proceedings, and (v) assessing LEAP Motion intervention for four specific psychological domains (i.e., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment), objectively. Nineteen eligible empirical studies were included. Overall, results show that protocols for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder can promote psychomotor and psychosocial rehabilitation in contexts that stimulate learning. Moreover, virtual reality and LEAP Motion seem promising for the assessment and screening of functional abilities in dementia and mild cognitive impairment. As evidence is, however, still limited, deeper investigations are needed to assess the full potential of the LEAP Motion technology, possibly extending its applications. This is relevant, considering the role that virtual reality could have in overcoming barriers to access assessment, therapies, and smart monitoring.",0,"LEAP Motion Technology and Psychology: A Mini-Review on Hand Movements Sensing for Neurodevelopmental and Neurocognitive Disorders Technological advancement is constantly evolving, and it is also developing in the mental health field.

"Analysis of spatial mobility in subjects from a Dengue endemic urban locality in Morelos State, Mexico","INTRODUCTION: Mathematical models and field data suggest that human mobility is an important driver for Dengue virus transmission. Nonetheless little is known on this matter due the lack of instruments for precise mobility quantification and study design difficulties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a cohort-nested, case-control study with 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) with the goal of describing human mobility patterns of recently Dengue virus-infected subjects, and comparing them with those of non-infected subjects living in an urban endemic locality. Mobility was quantified using a GPS-data logger registering waypoints at 60-second intervals for a minimum of 15 natural days. RESULTS: Although absolute displacement was highly biased towards the intradomestic and peridomestic areas, occasional displacements exceeding a 100-Km radius from the center of the studied locality were recorded for all three study groups and individual displacements were recorded traveling across six states from central Mexico. Additionally, cases had a larger number of visits out of the municipality´s administrative limits when compared to intradomestic controls (cases: 10.4 versus intradomestic controls: 2.9, p = 0.0282). We were able to identify extradomestic places within and out of the locality that were independently visited by apparently non-related infected subjects, consistent with houses, working and leisure places. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study show that human mobility in a small urban setting exceeded that considered by local health authority’s administrative limits, and was different between recently infected and non-infected subjects living in the same household. These observations provide important insights about the role that human mobility may have in Dengue virus transmission and persistence across endemic geographic areas that need to be taken into account when planning preventive and control measures. Finally, these results are a valuable reference when setting the parameters for future mathematical modeling studies.",0,"Analysis of spatial mobility in subjects from a Dengue endemic urban locality in Morelos State, Mexico INTRODUCTION: Mathematical models and field data suggest that human mobility is an important driver for Dengue virus transmission.

A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment,"The use of antiviral drugs has been recognized as the primary public health strategy for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic strain. However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy.",0,"A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment The use of antiviral drugs has been recognized as the primary public health strategy for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic strain.

"Association of Short-Term Exposure to Meteorological Factors and Risk of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","(1) Background: Inconsistencies were observed in studies on the relationship between short-term exposure to meteorological factors and the risk of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess the overall effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of HFMD to help clarify these inconsistencies and serve as a piece of evidence for policy makers to determine relevant risk factors. (2) Methods: Articles published as of 24 October 2020, were searched in the four databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and MEDLINE. We applied a meta-analysis to assess the impact of ambient temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and sunshine duration on the incidence of HFMD. We conducted subgroup analyses by exposure metrics, exposure time resolution, regional climate, national income level, gender, and age as a way to seek the source of heterogeneity. (3) Results: Screening by the given inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 28 studies were included in the analysis. We observed that the incidence of HFMD based on the single-day lag model is significantly associated with ambient temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. In the cumulative lag model, ambient temperature and relative humidity significantly increased the incidence of HFMD as well. Subgroup analysis showed that extremely high temperature and relative humidity significantly increased the risk of HFMD.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess the overall effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of HFMD to help clarify these inconsistencies and serve as a piece of evidence for policy makers to determine relevant risk factors. (2) Methods: Articles published as of 24 October 2020, were searched in the four databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and MEDLINE. We applied a meta-analysis to assess the impact of ambient temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and sunshine duration on the incidence of HFMD. We conducted subgroup analyses by exposure metrics, exposure time resolution, regional climate, national income level, gender, and age as a way to seek the source of heterogeneity. (3) Results: Screening by the given inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 28 studies were included in the analysis. We observed that the incidence of HFMD based on the single-day lag model is significantly associated with ambient temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. In the cumulative lag model, ambient temperature and relative humidity significantly increased the incidence of HFMD as well. Subgroup analysis showed that extremely high temperature and relative humidity significantly increased the risk of HFMD. Temperate regions, high-income countries, and children under five years old are major risk factors for HFMD.

Development of Saudi e-health literacy scale for chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia: using integrated health literacy dimensions,"OBJECTIVE: Health literacy has become a global issue, and it is important that patients and individuals are able to use information technology to access health information and educational services. The research objective is to develop a Saudi e-health literacy scale (SeHL) for measuring e-health literacy among Saudis suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCD). METHODS: Overall, 14 relevant papers in related interdisciplinary fields were reviewed to select the most useful literacy dimensions. From these articles, we extracted the most common dimensions used to measure e-health literacy across the disciplines. Multiple workshops with multidisciplinary team members reviewed and evaluated items for SeHL. RESULTS: Four key aspects of e-health literacy—use of technology/media, information-seeking, usefulness and confidence—were identified and integrated as e-health literacy dimensions. These will be used to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients with NCDs. A translation from Arabic to English was performed in order to ensure that translation process was accurate. A SeHL scale was developed to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients. By understanding e-health literacy levels, we will be able to create a patient-education system to be used by patients in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSIONS: As information technology is increasingly used by people of all ages all over the world, e-health literacy has been identified as a key factor in determining health outcomes. To date, no comprehensive scale exists to assess e-health literacy levels among speakers of Arabic, particularly among people with NCD such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension.",0,"Development of Saudi e-health literacy scale for chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia: using integrated health literacy dimensions OBJECTIVE: Health literacy has become a global issue, and it is important that patients and individuals are able to use information technology to access health information and educational services.

Development of treatment and clinical results in childhood AML in Austria (1993–2013),"BACKGROUND: Since the early 1990s, three consecutive pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) trials have been performed in Austria (AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) 93, AML-BFM 98, and AML-BFM 2004) in close cooperation with the international BFM study center. Herein, we review the pertinent patient characteristics, therapy, and outcome data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1993 to April 2013, 249 children and adolescents (193 protocol patients) diagnosed with AML were enrolled in the three BFM studies. Patients were mainly treated in one of five pediatric hematology/oncology centers distributed over Austria. RESULTS: Many characteristics and outcome parameters were not statistically different between the three trials. Almost similar proportions of patients were stratified into two risk groups: standard risk (SR) (approximately 37 % overall) and high-risk (HR) (61 %). MLL rearrangements were found in 23 % of patients overall as the most frequent genetic aberration subtype. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 84–95 % of patients. The most important type of event was leukemic relapse (5-year cumulative incidence 40 ± 8 %, 21 ± 5 %, and 39 ± 6 %; p = 0.058), with a trend to a higher rate specifically in SR patients of study AML-BFM 2004 compared with AML-BFM 98. Importantly, the frequency of death from causes other than relapse sequelae declined over the years (AML-BFM 93: 5/42 12 %, AML-BFM 98: 5/57 9 %, and AML-BFM 2004: 5/94 5 %). Altogether, event-free survival at 5 years varied insignificantly (48 ± 8 %, 61 ± 7 %, and 50 ± 6 %; p = 0.406). Nevertheless, survival (pSU) apparently improved from BFM 93 to subsequent studies, both overall (57 ± 8 %, 75 ± 6 %, and 62 ± 6 %; p = 0.046) and regarding the HR group (5-year-probability of survival (pSU) 40 ± 10 %, 66 ± 8 %, and 52 ± 8 %; p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Treatment of pediatric AML in Austria renders survival rates in the range of international best practice. However, unambiguous statistical comparison of treatment periods is eventually hampered by small numbers and inequalities of recruitment. Hence, only internationally collaborative trials will allow developing treatment further to achieve higher cure rates with fewer events.",0,"Development of treatment and clinical results in childhood AML in Austria (1993–2013) BACKGROUND: Since the early 1990s, three consecutive pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) trials have been performed in Austria (AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) 93, AML-BFM 98, and AML-BFM 2004) in close cooperation with the international BFM study center.

"Pre-Travel Medical Preparation of Business and Occupational Travelers: An Analysis of the Global TravEpiNet Consortium, 2009 to 2012","The aim of the study was to understand more about pre-travel preparations and itineraries of business and occupational travelers. METHODS: De-identified data from 18 Global TravEpiNet clinics from January 2009 to December 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 23,534 travelers, 61% were non-occupational and 39% occupational. Business travelers were more likely to be men, had short times to departure and shorter trip durations, and commonly refused influenza, meningococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. Most business travelers indicated that employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, whereas non-occupational travelers sought consultations because of travel health concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-groups of occupational travelers have characteristic profiles, with business travelers being particularly distinct.

Restrictive Measures in an Influenza Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Public Perspectives,"OBJECTIVES: Recent experiences have demonstrated that restrictive measures remain a useful public health tool during infectious disease outbreaks. However, the use of restrictive measures is not without controversy, as there is no agreed-upon threshold for when and how to invoke restrictive measures. The objectives of this study are to solicit perspectives from Canadians on the ethical considerations of using restrictive measures in response to influenza pandemics, and in turn, to use public views to contribute to a better understanding of what is considered to be the justifiable use of restrictive measures. METHODS: A series of town hall focus groups with Canadian residents from June 2008 to May 2009, in three Canadian regions, in order to achieve broad public engagement (n=3 focus groups with a total of 17 participants). RESULTS: Two key themes emerged from all town hall focus groups: 1) create an environment for compliance through communication rather than enforcement, and 2) establish the delineation between individual rights, community values, and the greater good. CONCLUSION: While there is a need for a decision-making authority and even a mechanism for enforcement, our data suggest that a more tractable approach to restrictive measures is one that enables individuals to voluntarily comply by creating an environment to compel compliance based on communication. This approach requires restrictive measures to be a) proportional to the threat, b) implemented along with reciprocal arrangements provided to those affected, and c) accompanied by open and transparent communication throughout all stages so that citizens can both understand and participate in decision-making.",0,"Restrictive Measures in an Influenza Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Public Perspectives OBJECTIVES: Recent experiences have demonstrated that restrictive measures remain a useful public health tool during infectious disease outbreaks.

Achievements and new knowledge unraveled by metagenomic approaches,"Metagenomics has paved the way for cultivation-independent assessment and exploitation of microbial communities present in complex ecosystems. In recent years, significant progress has been made in this research area. A major breakthrough was the improvement and development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies. The application of these technologies resulted in the generation of large datasets derived from various environments such as soil and ocean water. The analyses of these datasets opened a window into the enormous phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of microbial communities living in a variety of ecosystems. In this way, structure, functions, and interactions of microbial communities were elucidated. Metagenomics has proven to be a powerful tool for the recovery of novel biomolecules. In most cases, functional metagenomics comprising construction and screening of complex metagenomic DNA libraries has been applied to isolate new enzymes and drugs of industrial importance. For this purpose, several novel and improved screening strategies that allow efficient screening of large collections of clones harboring metagenomes have been introduced.",0,"Achievements and new knowledge unraveled by metagenomic approaches Metagenomics has paved the way for cultivation-independent assessment and exploitation of microbial communities present in complex ecosystems.

Animal models to improve our understanding and treatment of suicidal behavior,"Worldwide, suicide is a leading cause of death. Although a sizable proportion of deaths by suicide may be preventable, it is well documented that despite major governmental and international investments in research, education and clinical practice suicide rates have not diminished and are even increasing among several at-risk populations. Although nonhuman animals do not engage in suicidal behavior amenable to translational studies, we argue that animal model systems are necessary to investigate candidate endophenotypes of suicidal behavior and the neurobiology underlying these endophenotypes. Animal models are similarly a critical resource to help delineate treatment targets and pharmacological means to improve our ability to manage the risk of suicide. In particular, certain pathophysiological pathways to suicidal behavior, including stress and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction, neurotransmitter system abnormalities, endocrine and neuroimmune changes, aggression, impulsivity and decision-making deficits, as well as the role of critical interactions between genetic and epigenetic factors, development and environmental risk factors can be modeled in laboratory animals. We broadly describe human biological findings, as well as protective effects of medications such as lithium, clozapine, and ketamine associated with modifying risk of engaging in suicidal behavior that are readily translatable to animal models. Endophenotypes of suicidal behavior, studied in animal models, are further useful for moving observed associations with harmful environmental factors (for example, childhood adversity, mechanical trauma aeroallergens, pathogens, inflammation triggers) from association to causation, and developing preventative strategies. Further study in animals will contribute to a more informed, comprehensive, accelerated and ultimately impactful suicide research portfolio.",0,"Animal models to improve our understanding and treatment of suicidal behavior Worldwide, suicide is a leading cause of death.

Inflammatory Molecules Associated with Ultraviolet Radiation-Mediated Skin Aging,"Skin is the largest and most complex organ in the human body comprised of multiple layers with different types of cells. Different kinds of environmental stressors, for example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), temperature, air pollutants, smoking, and diet, accelerate skin aging by stimulating inflammatory molecules. Skin aging caused by UVR is characterized by loss of elasticity, fine lines, wrinkles, reduced epidermal and dermal components, increased epidermal permeability, delayed wound healing, and approximately 90% of skin aging. These external factors can cause aging through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inflammation, as well as aged skin is a source of circulatory inflammatory molecules which accelerate skin aging and cause aging-related diseases.

Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency,"BACKGROUND: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability. The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health. This was conducted in context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS), the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in Minnesota. Data Quality (DQ) dimensions by Strong et al., was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation. METHODS: The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended format from November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team. RESULTS: All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a combined effort by MEDSS Informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals. CONCLUSION: With increasing electronic reporting to public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future.",0,"Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency BACKGROUND: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability.

OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health. This was conducted in context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS), the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in Minnesota. Data Quality (DQ) dimensions by Strong et al., was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation. METHODS: The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended format from November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team. RESULTS: All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a combined effort by MEDSS Informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals. CONCLUSION: With increasing electronic reporting to public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future.",evaluation of data exchange process for interoperability and impact on electronic laboratory reporting quality to a state public health agency background past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability the critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting elr many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts objectives the study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health this was conducted in context of minnesota electronic disease surveillance system medss the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in minnesota data quality dq dimensions by strong et al was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation methods the process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the medss system interviews were conducted in an openended format from november 2017 through february 2018 based on these discussions two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing this in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input this was followed by analysis of data in medss by various criteria identified by the informatics team results all dq metrics intrinsic dq contextual dq representational dq and accessibility dq were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on dq dimensions some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records ehrs and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists some dq dimensions such as accuracy relevancy valueadded data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals the study revealed that data quality is dynamic and ongoing oversight is a combined effort by medss informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals conclusion with increasing electronic reporting to public health there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data this study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently eg immunizations and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future,1
"Deceased Organ Transplantation in Bangladesh: The Dynamics of Bioethics, Religion and Culture","Organ transplantation from living related donors in Bangladesh first began in October 1982, and became commonplace in 1988. Cornea transplantation from posthumous donors began in 1984 and living related liver and bone marrow donor transplantation began in 2010 and 2014 respectively. The Human Organ Transplantation Act officially came into effect in Bangladesh on 13th April 1999, allowing organ donation from both brain-dead and related living donors for transplantation. Before the legislation, religious leaders issued fatwa, or religious rulings, in favor of organ transplantation. The Act was amended by the Parliament on 8th January, 2018 with the changes coming into effect shortly afterwards on 28th January. However, aside from a few posthumous corneal donations, transplantation of vital organs, such as the kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, and other body parts or organs from deceased donors, has remained absent in Bangladesh. The major question addressed in this article is why the transplantation of vital organs from deceased donors is absent in Bangladesh. In addition to the collection of secondary documents, interviews were conducted with senior transplant physicians, patients and their relatives, and the public, to learn about posthumous organ donation for transplantation. Interviews were also conducted with a medical student and two grief counselors to understand the process of counseling the families and obtaining consent to obtain posthumous cornea donations from brain-dead patients. An interview was conducted with a professional anatomist to understand the processes behind body donation for the purposes of medical study and research. Their narrative reveals that transplant physicians may be reticent to declare brain death as the stipulations of the 1999 act were unclear and vague. This study finds that Bangladeshis have strong family ties and experience anxiety around permitting separating body parts of dead relatives for organ donation for transplantation, or donating the dead body for medical study and research purposes. Posthumous organ donation for transplantation is commonly viewed as a wrong deed from a religious point of view. Religious scholars who have been consulted by the government have approved posthumous organ donation for transplantation on the grounds of necessity to save lives even though violating the human body is generally forbidden in Islam. An assessment of the dynamics of biomedicine, religion and culture leads to the conclusion that barriers to posthumous organ donation for transplantation that are perceived to be religious may actually stem from cultural attitudes. The interplay of faith, belief, religion, social norms, rituals and wider cultural attitudes with biomedicine and posthumous organ donation and transplantation is very complex. Although overcoming the barriers to organ donation for transplantation is challenging, initiation of transplantation of vital organs from deceased donors is necessary within Bangladesh. This will ensure improved healthcare outcomes, prevent poor people from being coerced into selling their organs to rich recipients, and protect the solidarity and progeny of Bangladeshi families.",0,"Deceased Organ Transplantation in Bangladesh: The Dynamics of Bioethics, Religion and Culture Organ transplantation from living related donors in Bangladesh first began in October 1982, and became commonplace in 1988.

Periodontal Disease and Senescent Cells: New Players for an Old Oral Health Problem?,"The recent identification of senescent cells in periodontal tissues has the potential to provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of periodontal disease etiology. DNA damage-driven senescence is perhaps one of the most underappreciated delayed consequences of persistent Gram-negative bacterial infection and inflammation. Although the host immune response rapidly protects against bacterial invasion, oxidative stress generated during inflammation can indirectly deteriorate periodontal tissues through the damage to vital cell macromolecules, including DNA. What happens to those healthy cells that reside in this harmful environment? Emerging evidence indicates that cells that survive irreparable genomic damage undergo cellular senescence, a crucial intermediate mechanism connecting DNA damage and the immune response. In this review, we hypothesize that sustained Gram-negative bacterial challenge, chronic inflammation itself, and the constant renewal of damaged tissues create a permissive environment for the abnormal accumulation of senescent cells. Based on emerging data we propose a model in which the dysfunctional presence of senescent cells may aggravate the initial immune reaction against pathogens. Further understanding of the role of senescent cells in periodontal disease pathogenesis may have clinical implications by providing more sophisticated therapeutic strategies to combat tissue destruction.",0,"Periodontal Disease and Senescent Cells: New Players for an Old Oral Health Problem?

"Imaging, Tracking and Computational Analyses of Virus Entry and Egress with the Cytoskeleton","Viruses have a dual nature: particles are “passive substances” lacking chemical energy transformation, whereas infected cells are “active substances” turning-over energy. How passive viral substances convert to active substances, comprising viral replication and assembly compartments has been of intense interest to virologists, cell and molecular biologists and immunologists. Infection starts with virus entry into a susceptible cell and delivers the viral genome to the replication site. This is a multi-step process, and involves the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. Likewise, the egress of progeny virus particles from the replication site to the extracellular space is enhanced by the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. This overcomes the limitation of thermal diffusion, and transports virions and virion components, often in association with cellular organelles. This review explores how the analysis of viral trajectories informs about mechanisms of infection. We discuss the methodology enabling researchers to visualize single virions in cells by fluorescence imaging and tracking. Virus visualization and tracking are increasingly enhanced by computational analyses of virus trajectories as well as in silico modeling. Combined approaches reveal previously unrecognized features of virus-infected cells. Using select examples of complementary methodology, we highlight the role of actin filaments and microtubules, and their associated motors in virus infections. In-depth studies of single virion dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolutions thereby provide deep insight into virus infection processes, and are a basis for uncovering underlying mechanisms of how cells function.",0,"Imaging, Tracking and Computational Analyses of Virus Entry and Egress with the Cytoskeleton Viruses have a dual nature: particles are “passive substances” lacking chemical energy transformation, whereas infected cells are “active substances” turning-over energy.

0177 Bovine macrophage phenotype influences inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide,"Severe inflammation during gram negative bacterial disease is common in periparturient dairy cows and increases the severity of diseases such as Escherichia coli mastitis. Tissue inflammation is partly orchestrated by macrophage responses to bacterial infection. Studies in monogastric species showed classical phenotype macrophages have proinflammatory responses and alternative phenotype macrophages have protective and restorative responses during disease. However, responses of diverse bovine macrophage phenotypes to lipopolysaccharide are unclear. The objective of this research was to compare the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in several phenotypes of bovine primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll (n = 8 cows). Monocytes were identified using mouse anti-bovine CD172α monoclonal antibody and separated from lymphocytes using magnetic assisted cell sorting. Monocytes were cultured with interferon-γ or interleukins (IL) 4 and 13 to induce a classical or alternative macrophage phenotype, respectively, then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Macrophage mRNA was quantified in adipose using qPCR. Fold changes in mRNA concentration were calculated by 2(-ΔΔCt), using the untreated cells as calibrator and three endogenous control mRNA. Treatment differences in mRNA expression were identified using Fisher pairwise comparisons and ANOVA (P ≤ 0.05). Flow cytometry showed magnetic assisted cell sorting increased CD172α(+) cells from 22.3 ± 1.9 to 81.6 ± 2.8%. After 48 h in vitro, CD68 expression increased and CD172α(+) was 95.2 ± 0.4%. Lipopolysaccharide increased IL6, IL10, TNF, and CCL2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated IL6 and IL10 expression was decreased in alternative macrophages, whereas lipopolysaccharide stimulated TNF expression was increased in classical macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated CCL2 expression was not different between macrophage types. Together these results show an exacerbated proinflammatory cytokine profile in a model of classical bovine macrophages during gram negative bacterial disease. Results suggest that macrophage phenotype could be involved with severe inflammatory responses seen during dairy cow periparturient periods characterized by prolonged and exacerbated lipolysis and increased disease susceptibility. Ongoing research will describe macrophage phenotype during bovine disease and identify factors contributing to phenotype change. Such factors could ultimately be manipulated to control the bovine macrophage inflammatory response.",0,"0177 Bovine macrophage phenotype influences inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide Severe inflammation during gram negative bacterial disease is common in periparturient dairy cows and increases the severity of diseases such as Escherichia coli mastitis.

Advance care planning in older hospitalised patients following an emergency admission: A mixed methods study,"INTRODUCTION: Although advance care planning may be beneficial for older adults in the last year of life, its relevance following an emergency hospitalisation requires further investigation. This study quantifies the one-year mortality outcomes of all emergency admissions for patients aged 70+ years and explores patient views on the value of advance care planning following acute hospitalisation. METHOD: This mixed methods study used a two-stage approach: firstly, a quantitative longitudinal cohort study exploring the one-year mortality of patients aged 70+ admitted as an emergency to a large multi-centre hospital cohort; secondly, a qualitative semi-structured interview study gathering information on patient views of advance care planning. RESULTS: There were 14,260 emergency admissions for 70+-year olds over a 12-month period. One-year mortality for admissions across all conditions was 22.6%. The majority of these deaths (59.3%) were within 3 months of admission. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated higher one-year mortality with increasing age and male sex. Interviews with 20 patients resulted in one superordinate theme, “Planning for health and wellbeing in the spectrum of illness”. Sub-themes entitled (1) Advance care planning benefitting healthcare for physical and psycho-social health, (2) Contemplation of physical deterioration death and dying and 3) Collaborating with healthcare professionals to undertake advance care planning, suggest that views of advance care planning are shaped by experiences of acute hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: Since approximately 1 in 5 patients aged 70+ admitted to hospital as an emergency are in the last year of life, acute hospitalisation can act as a trigger for tailored ACP. Older hospitalised patients believe that advance care planning can benefit physical and psychosocial health and that discussions should consider a spectrum of possibilities, from future health to the potential of chronic illness, disability and death. In this context, patients may look for expertise from healthcare professionals for planning their future care.",0,"Advance care planning in older hospitalised patients following an emergency admission: A mixed methods study INTRODUCTION: Although advance care planning may be beneficial for older adults in the last year of life, its relevance following an emergency hospitalisation requires further investigation.

Porcine Circoviruses and Xenotransplantation,"Allotransplantation and xenotransplantation may be associated with the transmission of pathogens from the donor to the recipient. Whereas in the case of allotransplantation the transmitted microorganisms and their pathogenic effect are well characterized, the possible influence of porcine microorganisms on humans is mostly unknown. Porcine circoviruses (PCVs) are common in pig breeds and they belong to porcine microorganisms that still have not been fully addressed in terms of evaluating the potential risk of xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues, and organs. Two types of PCVs are known: porcine circovirus (PCV) 1 and PCV2. Whereas PCV1 is apathogenic in pigs, PCV2 may induce severe pig diseases. Although most pigs are subclinically infected, we do not know whether this infection impairs pig transplant functionality, particularly because PCV2 is immunosuppressive. In addition, vaccination against PCV2 is able to prevent diseases, but in most cases not transmission of the virus. Therefore, PCV2 has to be eliminated to obtain xenotransplants from uninfected healthy animals. Although there is evidence that PCV2 does not infect—at least immunocompetent—humans, animals should be screened using sensitive methods to ensure virus elimination by selection, Cesarean delivery, vaccination, or embryo transfer.",0,"Porcine Circoviruses and Xenotransplantation Allotransplantation and xenotransplantation may be associated with the transmission of pathogens from the donor to the recipient.

Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of Human Parainfluenza Viruses 1–4 in Children from Viet Nam,"HPIVs are serologically and genetically grouped into four species that account for up to 10% of all hospitalizations due to acute respiratory infection in children under the age of five. Genetic and epidemiological data for the four HPIVs derived from two pediatric cohorts in Viet Nam are presented. Respiratory samples were screened for HPIV1–4 by real-time PCR. Demographic and clinical data of patients infected with different HPIV were compared. We used a hemi-nested PCR approach to generate viral genome sequences from HPIV-positive samples and conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. In total, 170 samples tested positive for HPIV. HPIV3 was most commonly detected in our cohort and 80 co-detections of HPIV with other respiratory viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses suggest local endemic circulation as well as punctuated introductions of new HPIV lineages. Viral gene flow analysis revealed that Viet Nam is a net importer of viral genetic diversity. Epidemiological analyses imply similar disease severity for all HPIV species. HPIV sequences from Viet Nam formed local clusters and were interspersed with sequences from diverse geographic regions. Combined, this new knowledge will help to investigate global HPIV circulation patterns in more detail and ultimately define more suitable vaccine strains.",0,"Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology of Human Parainfluenza Viruses 1–4 in Children from Viet Nam HPIVs are serologically and genetically grouped into four species that account for up to 10% of all hospitalizations due to acute respiratory infection in children under the age of five.

Defensins Potentiate a Neutralizing Antibody Response to Enteric Viral Infection,"α-defensins are abundant antimicrobial peptides with broad, potent antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities in vitro. Although their contribution to host defense against bacteria in vivo has been demonstrated, comparable studies of their antiviral activity in vivo are lacking. Using a mouse model deficient in activated α-defensins in the small intestine, we show that Paneth cell α-defensins protect mice from oral infection by a pathogenic virus, mouse adenovirus 1 (MAdV-1). Survival differences between mouse genotypes are lost upon parenteral MAdV-1 infection, strongly implicating a role for intestinal defenses in attenuating pathogenesis. Although differences in α-defensin expression impact the composition of the ileal commensal bacterial population, depletion studies using broad-spectrum antibiotics revealed no effect of the microbiota on α-defensin-dependent viral pathogenesis. Moreover, despite the sensitivity of MAdV-1 infection to α-defensin neutralization in cell culture, we observed no barrier effect due to Paneth cell α-defensin activation on the kinetics and magnitude of MAdV-1 dissemination to the brain. Rather, a protective neutralizing antibody response was delayed in the absence of α-defensins. This effect was specific to oral viral infection, because antibody responses to parenteral or mucosal ovalbumin exposure were not affected by α-defensin deficiency. Thus, α-defensins play an important role as adjuvants in antiviral immunity in vivo that is distinct from their direct antiviral activity observed in cell culture.",0,"Defensins Potentiate a Neutralizing Antibody Response to Enteric Viral Infection α-defensins are abundant antimicrobial peptides with broad, potent antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities in vitro.

Mixed-methods economic evaluation of the implementation of tobacco treatment programs in National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers,"BACKGROUND: The Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) was launched in 2017 as a part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot program to assist NCI-designated cancer centers in developing tobacco treatment programs for oncology patients. Participating centers have implemented varied evidence-based programs that fit their institutional resources and needs, offering a wide range of services including in-person and telephone-based counseling, point of care, interactive voice response systems, referral to the quitline, text- and web-based services, and medications. METHODS: We used a mixed methods comparative case study design to evaluate system-level implementation costs across 15 C3I-funded cancer centers that reported for at least one 6-month period between July 2018 and June 2020. We analyzed operating costs by resource category (e.g., personnel, medications) concurrently with transcripts from semi-structured key-informant interviews conducted during site visits. Personnel salary costs were estimated using Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data adjusted for area and occupation, and non-wage benefits. Qualitative findings provided additional information on intangible resources and contextual factors related to implementation costs. RESULTS: Median total monthly operating costs across funded centers were $11,045 (range: $5129–$20,751). The largest median operating cost category was personnel ($10,307; range: $4122–$19,794), with the highest personnel costs attributable to the provision of in-person program services. Monthly (non-zero) cost ranges for other categories were medications ($17–$573), materials ($6–$435), training ($96–$516), technology ($171–$2759), and equipment ($10–$620). Median cost-per-participant was $466 (range: $70–$2093) and cost-per-quit was $2688 (range: $330–$9628), with sites offering different combinations of program components, ranging from individually-delivered in-person counseling only to one program that offered all components. Site interviews provided context for understanding variations in program components and their cost implications. CONCLUSIONS: Among most centers that have progressed in tobacco treatment program implementation, cost-per-quit was modest relative to other prevention interventions. Although select centers have achieved similar average costs by offering program components of various levels of intensity, they have varied widely in program reach and effectiveness. Evaluating implementation costs of such programs alongside reach and effectiveness is necessary to provide decision makers in oncology settings with the important additional information needed to optimize resource allocation when establishing tobacco treatment programs.",0,"Mixed-methods economic evaluation of the implementation of tobacco treatment programs in National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers BACKGROUND: The Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) was launched in 2017 as a part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot program to assist NCI-designated cancer centers in developing tobacco treatment programs for oncology patients.

Dissecting the Contemporary Clerkship: Theory‐based Educational Trial of Videos Versus Lectures in Medical Student Education,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing use of the flipped classroom (FC) technique in undergraduate medical education, the benefit in learning outcomes over lectures is inconsistent. Best practices in preclass video design principles are rarely used, and it is unclear if videos can replace lectures in contemporary medical education. METHODS: We conducted a prospective quasi‐experimental controlled educational study comparing theory‐based videos to traditional lectures in a medical student curriculum. Medical students enrolled in an emergency medicine clerkship were randomly assigned to either a lecture group (LG) or a video group (VG). The slide content was identical, and the videos aligned with cognitive load theory‐based multimedia design principles. Students underwent baseline (pretest), week 1 (posttest), and end‐of‐rotation (retention) written knowledge tests and an observed structured clinical examination (OSCE) assessment. We compared scores between both groups and surveyed student attitudes and satisfaction with respect to the two learning methods. RESULTS: There were 104 students who participated in OSCE assessments (49 LG, 55 VG) and 101 students who participated in knowledge tests (48 LG, 53 VG). The difference in OSCE scores was statistically significant 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 0.23 to 2.35, t(102) = 2.43, p = 0.017), but the actual score difference was small from an educational standpoint (12.61 for LG, 11.32 for VG). All three knowledge test scores for both groups were not significantly different.

"Awareness, Knowledge, Attitude and Preventive Practice of Leptospirosis Among Healthy Malaysian and Non-Malaysian Wet Market Workers in Selected Urban Areas in Selangor, Malaysia","Leptospirosis has been reported as an endemic in most tropical countries. Among high risk occupations, leptospirosis includes workers in agriculture and domestic animal industries. Environmental hygiene in the wet market has established a link between the presence of rodents with probability of leptospirosis infection. This study was aimed to compare the level of knowledge, attitude and preventive practice against leptospirosis between healthy Malaysian and non-Malaysian wet market workers in selected wet markets in urban areas of Selangor. A cross-sectional study in the determined area was conducted with the participation of 147 respondents. The respondents were randomly chosen from the list provided by the state agency that regulates these markets. A self-administered bilingual validated questionnaire (English and Bahasa Melayu) was distributed to the selected respondents. There were 68 (48.3%) Malaysian respondents and 79 (53.7%) non-Malaysian respondents. The majority of them were males, who attained formal education and were less than 40 years old. Meanwhile, the respondents earned less than RM3000. Among the Malaysian respondents, 80.9% were aware of leptospirosis as compared to 17.7% of the non-Malaysian colleagues (p < 0.05). All items of knowledge showed that the Malaysian respondents scored higher as compared to non-Malaysian respondents. On attitude towards infection prevention, most Malaysian respondents had a positive attitude, while most non-Malaysian respondents had undecided perception on the majority of crucial attitude items. In practicing preventive measures, there was a marked significant difference in proportion between Malaysian and non-Malaysian respondents for items on “Specific Protection and Isolation at Source.” There was a significant gap on knowledge, attitude and preventive practice among Malaysian workers as compared to non-Malaysian workers. Therefore, it was highly recommended the health promotion implementation should also provide specific focus on non-Malaysian workers.",0,"Awareness, Knowledge, Attitude and Preventive Practice of Leptospirosis Among Healthy Malaysian and Non-Malaysian Wet Market Workers in Selected Urban Areas in Selangor, Malaysia Leptospirosis has been reported as an endemic in most tropical countries.

Spatiotemporal DNA methylome dynamics of the developing mouse fetus,"Cytosine DNA methylation is essential for mammalian development but understanding of its spatiotemporal distribution in the developing embryo remains limited(1,2). Here, as part of the mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, we profiled 168 methylomes from 12 mouse tissues or organs at 9 developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. We identified 1,808,810 genomic regions that showed variations in CG methylation by comparing the methylomes of different tissues or organs from different developmental stages. These DNA elements predominantly lose CG methylation during fetal development, whereas the trend is reversed after birth. During late stages of fetal development, non-CG methylation accumulated within the bodies of key developmental transcription factor genes, coinciding with their transcriptional repression. Integration of genome-wide DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin accessibility data enabled us to predict 461,141 putative developmental tissue-specific enhancers, the human orthologues of which were enriched for disease-associated genetic variants. These spatiotemporal epigenome maps provide a resource for studies of gene regulation during tissue or organ progression, and a starting point for investigating regulatory elements that are involved in human developmental disorders.",0,"Spatiotemporal DNA methylome dynamics of the developing mouse fetus Cytosine DNA methylation is essential for mammalian development but understanding of its spatiotemporal distribution in the developing embryo remains limited(1,2).

Immunity against a Japanese local strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus decreases viremia and symptoms of a highly pathogenic strain,"BACKGROUND: The type 2 highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has spread throughout countries of southeast Asia, where it has caused severe economic losses. Even countries presently free of PRRSV are at high risk for infection and spread of this virus. Some of these countries, including Japan, have broad epidemics of the local type 2 PRRSV, creating chronic pathogenicity in the domestic pig population. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective efficacy of immunity by infection with a Japanese field isolate, EDRD1, against heterologous challenge with a Vietnamese HP-PRRSV field strain. To this end, four groups of PRRSV-negative crossbreed piglets were used for a challenge study. Groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with EDRD1 via the intranasal route. After 26 days, Groups 2 and 3 were inoculated with HP-PRRSV via the same route. Group 4 served as an uninfected control. Blood and oral fluid samples were taken every 3–4 days after HP-PRRSV challenge; on day 16 post-challenge, all pigs were euthanized, and examined pathologically. RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence analysis of nonstructural protein 2 gene of EDRD1 and comparison with Vietnamese HP-PRRSV showed that the 39 amino acid deletion sites of EDRD1 was nearly in the same region as the 29 amino acid deletion sites of HP-PRRSV. Immunity conferred by inoculation with EDRD1 dramatically reduced viral load in the sera and tissues besides viral shedding (Group 2) compared with those in pigs infected only with HP-PRRSV (Group 3). The clinical signs and rectal temperature were significantly reduced, and the average daily weight gain was significantly improved in the EDRD1-inoculated pigs (Group 2) compared with the Group 3 pigs. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in various organs of the Group 2 pigs 16 days post-infection with HP-PRRSV, except in one pig. Therefore, the immunity induced by EDRD1 and its genetically close field isolates may play a role in reducing viremia caused by HP-PRRSV. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that pigs are highly protected against heterologous Vietnamese HP-PRRSV challenge by immunity against a Japanese local strain, EDRD1.",0,"Immunity against a Japanese local strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus decreases viremia and symptoms of a highly pathogenic strain BACKGROUND: The type 2 highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has spread throughout countries of southeast Asia, where it has caused severe economic losses. Even countries presently free of PRRSV are at high risk for infection and spread of this virus. Some of these countries, including Japan, have broad epidemics of the local type 2 PRRSV, creating chronic pathogenicity in the domestic pig population. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective efficacy of immunity by infection with a Japanese field isolate, EDRD1, against heterologous challenge with a Vietnamese HP-PRRSV field strain. To this end, four groups of PRRSV-negative crossbreed piglets were used for a challenge study. Groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with EDRD1 via the intranasal route. After 26 days, Groups 2 and 3 were inoculated with HP-PRRSV via the same route. Group 4 served as an uninfected control. Blood and oral fluid samples were taken every 3–4 days after HP-PRRSV challenge; on day 16 post-challenge, all pigs were euthanized, and examined pathologically. RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence analysis of nonstructural protein 2 gene of EDRD1 and comparison with Vietnamese HP-PRRSV showed that the 39 amino acid deletion sites of EDRD1 was nearly in the same region as the 29 amino acid deletion sites of HP-PRRSV.

Susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells to different viruses,"• BACKGROUND: Different viruses have been reported to be involved in retinal diseases in animalsystems. In humans, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have been found to cause retinal disease. Most of the studied viruses are neurotropic. In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEC) to representative members of different groups of human pathogenic viruses was investigated. • METHODS: Early cultures of RPE C — after two or three passages — were infected with the following viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus types 1 and 7, measles virus, parainfluenza virus and coxsackie virus B3. • RESULTS: Cultures of RPE C could be infected with neurotropic viruses like HSV or measles virus as well as with typical respiratory viruses like parainfluenza or adenoviruses. Coxsackievirus, an enterovirus, replicated as well as human CMV whereas EBV and HHV-6, two lymphotropic viruses, failed to infect RPE. • CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a variety of viruses, including those causing rather common illnesses, might be capable of inducing retinal lesions under certain circumstances due to haematogenous spread during the course of viraemia.",0,"Susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells to different viruses • BACKGROUND: Different viruses have been reported to be involved in retinal diseases in animalsystems.

Exploratory Analysis of Methods for Automated Classification of Laboratory Test Orders into Syndromic Groups in Veterinary Medicine,"BACKGROUND: Recent focus on earlier detection of pathogen introduction in human and animal populations has led to the development of surveillance systems based on automated monitoring of health data. Real- or near real-time monitoring of pre-diagnostic data requires automated classification of records into syndromes–syndromic surveillance–using algorithms that incorporate medical knowledge in a reliable and efficient way, while remaining comprehensible to end users. METHODS: This paper describes the application of two of machine learning (Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees) and rule-based methods to extract syndromic information from laboratory test requests submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. RESULTS: High performance (F(1)-macro = 0.9995) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier, based on rule induction followed by manual modification during the construction phase, which also resulted in clear interpretability of the resulting classification process. An unmodified rule induction algorithm achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.979 though this fell to 0.677 when performance for individual classes was averaged in an unweighted manner (F(1-macro)), due to the fact that the algorithm failed to learn 3 of the 16 classes from the training set. Decision Trees showed equal interpretability to the rule-based approaches, but achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.923 (falling to 0.311 when classes are given equal weight). A Naïve Bayes classifier learned all classes and achieved high performance (F(1-micro) = 0.994 and F(1-macro) = .955), however the classification process is not transparent to the domain experts. CONCLUSION: The use of a manually customised rule set allowed for the development of a system for classification of laboratory tests into syndromic groups with very high performance, and high interpretability by the domain experts. Further research is required to develop internal validation rules in order to establish automated methods to update model rules without user input.",0,"Exploratory Analysis of Methods for Automated Classification of Laboratory Test Orders into Syndromic Groups in Veterinary Medicine BACKGROUND: Recent focus on earlier detection of pathogen introduction in human and animal populations has led to the development of surveillance systems based on automated monitoring of health data.

Using the Electronic Medical Record to Identify Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Toward a Replicable Automated Strategy,"BACKGROUND: Timely information about disease severity can be central to the detection and management of outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI), including influenza. We asked if two resources: 1) free text, and 2) structured data from an electronic medical record (EMR) could complement each other to identify patients with pneumonia, an ARI severity landmark. METHODS: A manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits with associated chest imaging identified x-ray reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa score = 0.88 (95% CI 0.82∶0.93)), along with attendant cases with Possible Pneumonia (adds either cough, sputum, fever/chills/night sweats, dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain) or with Pneumonia-in-Plan (adds pneumonia stated as a likely diagnosis by the provider). The x-ray reports served as a reference to develop a text classifier using machine-learning software that did not require custom coding. To identify pneumonia cases, the classifier was combined with EMR-based structured data and with text analyses aimed at ARI symptoms in clinical notes. RESULTS: 370 reference cases with Possible Pneumonia and 250 with Pneumonia-in-Plan were identified. The x-ray report text classifier increased the positive predictive value of otherwise identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms by 20–70%, while retaining sensitivities of 58–75%. These performance gains were independent of the case definitions and of whether patients were admitted to the hospital or sent home. Text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes did not add further value. CONCLUSION: Specialized software development is not required for automated text analyses to help identify pneumonia patients. These results begin to map an efficient, replicable strategy through which EMR data can be used to stratify ARI severity.",0,"Using the Electronic Medical Record to Identify Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Toward a Replicable Automated Strategy BACKGROUND: Timely information about disease severity can be central to the detection and management of outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI), including influenza.

The use of laparoscopy in abdominal emergencies,"Background: The purpose of this article is to describe our experience using laparoscopy in the management of emergent and acute abdominal conditions. Methods: Between March 1997 and November 2001, 277 consecutive minimally invasive procedures were performed for various nontrauma surgical emergencies. The indications for operation were nonspecific abdominal pain in 129 cases (46%), peritonitis in 64 cases (23%), small bowel obstruction in 52 cases (19%), complications after previous surgery or invasive procedures in 24 cases (9%), and sepsis of unknown origin in 8 cases (3%). Results: Laparoscopy obtained a correct diagnosis in 98.6% of the cases. In 207 patients (75%), the procedure was completed laparoscopically. An additional 35 patients (12.5%) required a target incision. The remaining 35 patients (12.5%) underwent formal laparotomy. The morbidity rate was 5.8%. No laparoscopy-related mortality was observed.

Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets,"The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results.

Using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation to investigate the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in explicit sequence learning,"Though we have a general understanding of the brain areas involved in motor sequence learning, there is more to discover about the neural mechanisms underlying skill acquisition. Skill acquisition may be subserved, in part, by interactions between the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex through a cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal network. In prior work, we investigated this network by targeting the cerebellum; here, we explored the consequence of stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) before administering an explicit motor sequence learning paradigm. Using a mixed within- and between- subjects design, we employed anodal (n = 24) and cathodal (n = 25) HD-tDCS (relative to sham) to temporarily alter brain function and examine effects on skill acquisition. The results indicate that both anodal and cathodal prefrontal stimulation impedes motor sequence learning, relative to sham. These findings suggest an overall negative influence of active prefrontal stimulation on the acquisition of a sequential pattern of finger movements. Collectively, this provides novel insight on the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in initial skill acquisition, when cognitive processes such as working memory are used. Exploring methods that may improve motor learning is important in developing therapeutic strategies for motor-related diseases and rehabilitation.",0,"Using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation to investigate the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in explicit sequence learning Though we have a general understanding of the brain areas involved in motor sequence learning, there is more to discover about the neural mechanisms underlying skill acquisition.

Optimal Blood Glucose Monitoring Interval for Insulin Infusion in Critically Ill Non-Cardiothoracic Patients: A Pilot Study,"OBJECTIVE: The American Diabetes Association and the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommend monitoring blood glucose (BG) every 1-2 hours in patients receiving insulin infusion to guide titration of insulin infusion to maintain serum glucose in the target range; however, this is based on weak evidence. We evaluated the compliance of hourly BG monitoring and relation of less frequent BG monitoring to glycemic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review performed on 56 consecutive adult patients who received intravenous insulin infusion for persistent hyperglycemia in the ICU at Saint Vincent Hospital, a tertiary care community hospital an urban setting in Northeast region of USA. The frequency of fingerstick blood glucose (FSBG) readings was reviewed for compliance with hourly FSBG monitoring per protocol and the impact of FSBG testing at different time intervals on the glycemic status. Depending on time interval of FSBG monitoring, the data was divided into three groups: Group A (<90 min), Group B (91-179 min) and Group C (≥180 min). RESULTS: The mean age was 69 years (48% were males), 77% patients had preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mean MPM II score was 41. Of the 1411 readings for BG monitoring on insulin infusion, 467 (33%) were in group A, 806 (57%) in group B and 138 (10%) in group C; hourly BG monitoring compliance was 12.6%. The overall glycemic status was similar among all groups. There were 14 (0.99%) hypoglycemic episodes observed. The rate of hypoglycemic episodes was similar in all three groups (p=0.55). CONCLUSION: In patients requiring insulin infusion for sustained hyperglycemia in ICU, the risk of hypoglycemic episodes was not significantly different with less frequent BG monitoring. The compliance to hourly blood glucose monitoring and ICU was variable, and hypoglycemic episodes were similar across the groups despite the variation in monitoring. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The importance of glycemic control in ICU has been well established and it is a resource intensive venture.

We evaluated the compliance of hourly BG monitoring and relation of less frequent BG monitoring to glycemic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review performed on 56 consecutive adult patients who received intravenous insulin infusion for persistent hyperglycemia in the ICU at Saint Vincent Hospital, a tertiary care community hospital an urban setting in Northeast region of USA. The frequency of fingerstick blood glucose (FSBG) readings was reviewed for compliance with hourly FSBG monitoring per protocol and the impact of FSBG testing at different time intervals on the glycemic status. Depending on time interval of FSBG monitoring, the data was divided into three groups: Group A (<90 min), Group B (91-179 min) and Group C (≥180 min). RESULTS: The mean age was 69 years (48% were males), 77% patients had preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mean MPM II score was 41. Of the 1411 readings for BG monitoring on insulin infusion, 467 (33%) were in group A, 806 (57%) in group B and 138 (10%) in group C; hourly BG monitoring compliance was 12.6%. The overall glycemic status was similar among all groups. There were 14 (0.99%) hypoglycemic episodes observed. The rate of hypoglycemic episodes was similar in all three groups (p=0.55). CONCLUSION: In patients requiring insulin infusion for sustained hyperglycemia in ICU, the risk of hypoglycemic episodes was not significantly different with less frequent BG monitoring. The compliance to hourly blood glucose monitoring and ICU was variable, and hypoglycemic episodes were similar across the groups despite the variation in monitoring. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The importance of glycemic control in ICU has been well established and it is a resource intensive venture. However, there are no major studies highlighting the most optimal time interval for blood glucose checks in critically ill patients on insulin infusion. With this study we hypothesize that time duration between blood glucose checks can be increased safely without any untoward effects.

Implications of copy number variation in people with chromosomal abnormalities: potential for greater variation in copy number state may contribute to variability of phenotype,"Copy number variation is common in the human genome with many regions, overlapping thousands of genes, now known to be deleted or amplified. Aneuploidies and other forms of chromosomal imbalance have a wide range of adverse phenotypes and are a common cause of birth defects resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. “Normal” copy number variants (CNVs) embedded within the regions of chromosome imbalance may affect the clinical outcomes by altering the local copy number of important genes or regulatory regions: this could alleviate or exacerbate certain phenotypes. In this way CNVs may contribute to the clinical variability seen in many disorders caused by chromosomal abnormalities, such as the congenital heart defects (CHD) seen in ~40% of Down’s syndrome (DS) patients. Investigation of CNVs may therefore help to pinpoint critical genes or regulatory elements, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, also shedding light on the aetiology of such phenotypes in people without major chromosome imbalances, and ultimately leading to their improved detection and treatment.",0,"Implications of copy number variation in people with chromosomal abnormalities: potential for greater variation in copy number state may contribute to variability of phenotype Copy number variation is common in the human genome with many regions, overlapping thousands of genes, now known to be deleted or amplified.

A Comprehensive Review on Human Aichi Virus,"Although norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and Astrovirus are considered the most important viral agents transmitted by food and water, in recent years other viruses, such as Aichi virus (AiV), have emerged as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with different foods. AiV belongs to the genus Kobuvirus of the family Picornaviridae. It is a virus with icosahedral morphology that presents a single stranded RNA genome with positive sense (8280 nucleotides) and a poly (A) chain. AiV was first detected from clinical samples and in recent years has been involved in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks from different world regions. Furthermore, several studies conducted in Japan, Germany, France, Tunisia and Spain showed a high prevalence of AiV antibodies in adults (between 80% and 99%), which is indicative of a large exposure to this virus. The aim of this review is to bring together all the discovered information about the emerging pathogen human Aichi virus (AiV), discussing the possibles routes of transmission, new detection techniques and future research. Although AiV is responsible for a low percentage of gastroenteritis outbreaks, the high seroprevalence shown by human populations indicates an evident role as an enteric agent. The low percentage of AiV detection could be explained by the fact that the pathogen is more associated to subclinical infections. Further studies will be needed to clarify the real impact of AiV in human health and its importance as a causative gastroenteritis agent worldwide.",0,"A Comprehensive Review on Human Aichi Virus Although norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and Astrovirus are considered the most important viral agents transmitted by food and water, in recent years other viruses, such as Aichi virus (AiV), have emerged as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with different foods.

"Virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus in humans: a systemic literature review","H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) caused human infections in 2013 in China. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that H7N9 AIV is a novel reassortant strain with pandemic potential. We conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of H7N9 AIV infection in humans. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza, which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however, H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays, for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development.

Frequency of Intimate Partner Violence among an Urban Emergency Department Sample: A Multilevel Analysis,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive public health problem. Within the U.S., urban emergency department (ED) patients have elevated prevalence of IPV, substance use, and other social problems compared to those in the general household population. Using a social-ecological framework, this cross-sectional study analyzes the extent to which individual, household, and neighborhood factors are associated with the frequency of IPV among a socially disadvantaged sample of urban ED patients. Confidential survey interviews were conducted with 1037 married/partnered study participants (46% male; 50% Hispanic; 29% African American) at a public safety-net hospital. Gender-stratified multilevel Tobit regression models were estimated for frequency of past-year physical IPV (perpetration and victimization) and frequency of severe IPV. Approximately 23% of participants reported IPV. Among men and women, impulsivity, adverse childhood experiences, substance use, and their spouse/partner’s hazardous drinking were associated with IPV frequency. Additionally, household food insufficiency, being fired or laid off from their job, perceived neighborhood disorder, and neighborhood demographic characteristics were associated with IPV frequency among women. Similar patterns were observed in models of severe IPV frequency.

Combining ambitious climate policies with efforts to eradicate poverty,"Climate change threatens to undermine efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. However, climate policies could impose a financial burden on the global poor through increased energy and food prices. Here, we project poverty rates until 2050 and assess how they are influenced by mitigation policies consistent with the 1.5 °C target. A continuation of historical trends will leave 350 million people globally in extreme poverty by 2030. Without progressive redistribution, climate policies would push an additional 50 million people into poverty. However, redistributing the national carbon pricing revenues domestically as an equal-per-capita climate dividend compensates this policy side effect, even leading to a small net reduction of the global poverty headcount (−6 million). An additional international climate finance scheme enables a substantial poverty reduction globally and also in Sub-Saharan Africa. Combining national redistribution with international climate finance thus provides an important entry point to climate policy in developing countries.",0,"Combining ambitious climate policies with efforts to eradicate poverty Climate change threatens to undermine efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

The intracellular dynamic of protein palmitoylation,"S-palmitoylation describes the reversible attachment of fatty acids (predominantly palmitate) onto cysteine residues via a labile thioester bond. This posttranslational modification impacts protein functionality by regulating membrane interactions, intracellular sorting, stability, and membrane micropatterning. Several recent findings have provided a tantalizing insight into the regulation and spatiotemporal dynamics of protein palmitoylation. In mammalian cells, the Golgi has emerged as a possible super-reaction center for the palmitoylation of peripheral membrane proteins, whereas palmitoylation reactions on post-Golgi compartments contribute to the regulation of specific substrates. In addition to palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, intracellular palmitoylation dynamics may also be controlled through interplay with distinct posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and nitrosylation.",0,"The intracellular dynamic of protein palmitoylation S-palmitoylation describes the reversible attachment of fatty acids (predominantly palmitate) onto cysteine residues via a labile thioester bond.

"Application Fever: Reviewing the Causes, Costs, and Cures for Residency Application Inflation","Over the past decade, the number of residency applications submitted per applicant has nearly doubled. This epidemic of “Application Fever” is expensive for applicants, burdensome for programs, and ultimately does not improve overall Match outcomes. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of Application Fever, with a focus on contributing factors and costs of this behavior. Application Fever has its origins in the early 1990s. At that time, the number of residency applicants began to outpace the number of available positions. Because an applicant who applies to more residency programs has a greater probability of securing a residency position than an otherwise equivalent applicant who applies to fewer, ""overapplication"" became a dominant strategy and residency applicants began to apply to more residency programs each year. This trend was enhanced and enabled by the introduction of the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Although Application Fever is a rational decision for applicants, it imposes a substantial evaluative burden on program directors and necessitates the use of convenience screening metrics. We then briefly review potential solutions, including informational strategies, application limits, and marketplace incentives to reduce application numbers. Although a fixed cap on applications would reduce application numbers and facilitate a holistic selection process, greater transparency from residency programs regarding their selection criteria would be required to help applicants choose where to apply. To improve the residency application process for programs and applicants alike, we call upon the medical community to further study Application Fever and carefully consider solutions, including fixed application caps.",0,"Application Fever: Reviewing the Causes, Costs, and Cures for Residency Application Inflation Over the past decade, the number of residency applications submitted per applicant has nearly doubled.

Inflammatory Correlated Response in Two Lines of Rabbit Selected Divergently for Litter Size Environmental Variability,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Animal welfare is a priority objective for the livestock industry. Litter size environmental variability has been related to environmental sensitivity. A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out successfully in rabbits over thirteen generations. The low line showed a lower inflammatory response and susceptibility to infectious disorders than the high line. In conclusion, the decrease of environmental sensitivity seems to increase the adaptation of the animal to the environment, and thus, its welfare. ABSTRACT: A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out in rabbits over thirteen generations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response in the two lines of the experiment, in order to analyse the effect of selection on susceptibility to diseases after challenging to stressful situations, such as 24 h after the first delivery. A total of 78 females were used in this study, 39 from each line. The line selected for litter size heterogeneity (the high line) showed lower white blood leukocyte count (WBC; −0.87 × 10(3)/µL), lower percentage of basophils (−0.11%), higher concentration of TNF-α (+13.8 pg/mL), and greater concentration of CRP (+38.1 µg/mL) than the line selected for litter size homogeneity (the low line). The high line had also higher concentrations of bilirubin, cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to the low line (difference between lines were +0.08 µmol/L, +0.14 µmol/L, +0.35 U/L and +2.4 U/L, respectively). The high line showed higher inflammatory response than the low line, in accordance with a larger susceptibility to infectious disorders. In conclusion, the line selected to increase litter size environmental variability seems to have poor capacity coping with environmental stressors.

Accounting for behavioral responses during a flu epidemic using home television viewing,"BACKGROUND: Theory suggests that individual behavioral responses impact the spread of flu-like illnesses, but this has been difficult to empirically characterize. Social distancing is an important component of behavioral response, though analyses have been limited by a lack of behavioral data. Our objective is to use media data to characterize social distancing behavior in order to empirically inform explanatory and predictive epidemiological models. METHODS: We use data on variation in home television viewing as a proxy for variation in time spent in the home and, by extension, contact. This behavioral proxy is imperfect but appealing since information on a rich and representative sample is collected using consistent techniques across time and most major cities. We study the April-May 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 in Central Mexico and examine the dynamic behavioral response in aggregate and contrast the observed patterns of various demographic subgroups. We develop and calibrate a dynamic behavioral model of disease transmission informed by the proxy data on daily variation in contact rates and compare it to a standard (non-adaptive) model and a fixed effects model that crudely captures behavior. RESULTS: We find that after a demonstrable initial behavioral response (consistent with social distancing) at the onset of the outbreak, there was attenuation in the response before the conclusion of the public health intervention. We find substantial differences in the behavioral response across age subgroups and socioeconomic levels. We also find that the dynamic behavioral and fixed effects transmission models better account for variation in new confirmed cases, generate more stable estimates of the baseline rate of transmission over time and predict the number of new cases over a short horizon with substantially less error. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that A/H1N1 had an innate transmission potential greater than previously thought but this was masked by behavioral responses.

Critical role of ethics in clinical management and public health response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic,"The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis. These debates include issues related to prevention and containment, management of the health care workforce, clinical care, and research design, all of which are situated within the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens of EVD-affected countries to respond to a disease outbreak. Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.",0,"Critical role of ethics in clinical management and public health response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis.

In Vivo Activity of Amodiaquine against Ebola Virus Infection,"During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Western Africa (2013‒2016), antimalarial treatment was administered to EVD patients due to the high coexisting malaria burden in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD. Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans. However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals. While amodiaquine on its own failed to demonstrate efficacy, we cannot exclude potential therapeutic value of amodiaquine when used in combination with artesunate or another antiviral.",0,"In Vivo Activity of Amodiaquine against Ebola Virus Infection During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Western Africa (2013‒2016), antimalarial treatment was administered to EVD patients due to the high coexisting malaria burden in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines.

A statistical method utilizing information of imported cases to estimate the transmissibility for an influenza pandemic,"BACKGROUND: In a new influenza pandemic, travel data such as arrival times of cases seeded by the originating country can be regarded as a combination of the epidemic size and the mobility networks of infections connecting the originating country with other regions. It can be a complete and timely source for estimating the basic reproduction number (R (0)), a key indicator of disease transmissibility. METHOD: In this study, we developed a likelihood-based method using arrival times of infected cases in different countries to estimate R (0) for influenza pandemics. A simulation was conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. We further applied the method to the outbreak of the influenza pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico. RESULTS: In the numerical application, the estimated R (0) was equal to 1.69 with a 95% confidence interval (1.65, 1.73). For the simulation results, the estimations were robust to the decline of travel rate and other parameter assumptions. Nevertheless, the estimates were moderately sensitive to the assumption of infectious duration. Generally, the findings were in line with other relevant studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach as well as the estimate is potential to assist officials in planning control and prevention measures. Improved coordination to streamline or even centralize surveillance of imported cases among countries will thus be beneficial to public health.",0,"A statistical method utilizing information of imported cases to estimate the transmissibility for an influenza pandemic BACKGROUND: In a new influenza pandemic, travel data such as arrival times of cases seeded by the originating country can be regarded as a combination of the epidemic size and the mobility networks of infections connecting the originating country with other regions.

Droplet-based high-throughput cultivation for accurate screening of antibiotic resistant gut microbes,"Traditional cultivation approaches in microbiology are labor-intensive, low-throughput, and yield biased sampling of environmental microbes due to ecological and evolutionary factors. New strategies are needed for ample representation of rare taxa and slow-growers that are often outcompeted by fast-growers in cultivation experiments. Here we describe a microfluidic platform that anaerobically isolates and cultivates microbial cells in millions of picoliter droplets and automatically sorts them based on colony density to enhance slow-growing organisms. We applied our strategy to a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) donor stool using multiple growth media, and found significant increase in taxonomic richness and larger representation of rare and clinically relevant taxa among droplet-grown cells compared to conventional plates. Furthermore, screening the FMT donor stool for antibiotic resistance revealed 21 populations that evaded detection in plate-based assessment of antibiotic resistance. Our method improves cultivation-based surveys of diverse microbiomes to gain deeper insights into microbial functioning and lifestyles.",0,"Droplet-based high-throughput cultivation for accurate screening of antibiotic resistant gut microbes Traditional cultivation approaches in microbiology are labor-intensive, low-throughput, and yield biased sampling of environmental microbes due to ecological and evolutionary factors.

Proteomic Analysis of Chicken Skeletal Muscle during Embryonic Development,"Embryonic growth and development of skeletal muscle is a major determinant of muscle mass, and has a significant effect on meat production in chicken. To assess the protein expression profiles during embryonic skeletal muscle development, we performed a proteomics analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) in leg muscle tissues of female Xinghua chicken at embryonic age (E) 11, E16, and 1-day post hatch (D1). We identified 3,240 proteins in chicken embryonic muscle and 491 of them were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.666 and p < 0.05). There were 19 up- and 32 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. E16 group, 238 up- and 227 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. D1 group, and 13 up- and 5 down-regulated proteins in E16 vs. D1 group. Protein interaction network analyses indicated that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the pathway of protein synthesis, muscle contraction, and oxidative phosphorylation. Integrative analysis of proteome and our previous transcriptome data found 189 differentially expressed proteins that correlated with their mRNA level. The interactions between these proteins were also involved in muscle contraction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. The lncRNA-protein interaction network found four proteins DMD, MYL3, TNNI2, and TNNT3 that are all involved in muscle contraction and may be lncRNA regulated. These results provide several candidate genes for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of chicken embryonic muscle development, and enable us to better understanding their regulation networks and biochemical pathways.",0,"Proteomic Analysis of Chicken Skeletal Muscle during Embryonic Development Embryonic growth and development of skeletal muscle is a major determinant of muscle mass, and has a significant effect on meat production in chicken.

16S ribosomal RNA sequencing reveals a modulation of intestinal microbiome and immune response by dietary L-theanine supplementation in broiler chickens,"Despite the availability of abundant literature on green tea, studies on the use of L-theanine (an amino acid found only in green tea) as a feed additive in poultry especially broiler are limited. So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet + 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet + 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet + 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine significantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P < 0.05). Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P < 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.",0,"16S ribosomal RNA sequencing reveals a modulation of intestinal microbiome and immune response by dietary L-theanine supplementation in broiler chickens Despite the availability of abundant literature on green tea, studies on the use of L-theanine (an amino acid found only in green tea) as a feed additive in poultry especially broiler are limited.

Efficacy of Smart Speaker–Based Metamemory Training in Older Adults: Case-Control Cohort Study,"BACKGROUND: Metamemory training (MMT) is a useful training strategy for improving cognitive functioning in the older adult population. Despite the advantages, there are limitations imposed by location and time constraints. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a smart speaker–based MMT program and evaluate the efficacy of the program in older adults without cognitive impairment. METHODS: This study used a case-control cohort design. The smart speaker–based MMT program comprised 3 training sessions per day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks. Each training session took approximately 15 minutes. This program was implemented using smart speakers, not human trainers. All participants completed the Mini-Mental State Examination, Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire, Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, fluency tests, and a short-form version of the Geriatric Depression Scale before and after training. RESULTS: A total of 60 subjects (29 in the MMT group and 31 in the control group) participated in the study. The training group showed significant increases in the delayed free recall, digit span forward, digit span backward, and fluency test scores compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the efficacy of smart speaker–based MMT in older adults. Home-based smart speaker–based MMT is not limited with respect to location or constrained by space and may help older adults with subjective cognitive decline without requiring intervention by human professionals.",0,"Efficacy of Smart Speaker–Based Metamemory Training in Older Adults: Case-Control Cohort Study BACKGROUND: Metamemory training (MMT) is a useful training strategy for improving cognitive functioning in the older adult population.

Environmental Pathology,"Humans are constantly exposed to hazardous pollutants in the environment—for example, in the air, water, soil, rocks, diet, or workplace. Trace metals are important in environmental pathology because of the wide range of toxic reactions and their potential adverse effects on the physiological function of organ systems. Exposures to toxic trace metals have been the subject of numerous environmental and geochemical investigations, and many studies have been published on the acute and/or chronic effects of high-level exposures to these types of agents; however, much fewer data are available concerning the health effects of low-dose chronic exposure to many trace metals.

Mechanism of Preferential Packaging of Negative Sense Genomic RNA by Viral Nucleoproteins in Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus,"The Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an infectious disease of high virulence and mortality caused by a negative sense RNA nairovirus. The genomic RNA of CCHFV is enwrapped by its nucleoprotein. Positively charged residues on CCHFV nucleoprotein provide multiple binding sites to facilitate genomic RNA encapsidation. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism underlying preferential packaging of the negative sense genomic RNA by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of host cell RNAs during viral assembly. The work included genome sequence analyses for different families of negative and positive sense RNA viruses, using serial docking experiments and molecular dynamic simulations. Our results indicated that the main determinant parameter of the nucleoprotein binding affinity for negative sense RNA is the ratio of purine/pyrimidine in the RNA molecule. A negative sense RNA with a purine/pyrimidine ratio (>1) higher than that of a positive sense RNA (<1) exhibits higher affinity for the nucleoprotein. Our calculations revealed that a negative sense RNA expresses about 0.5 kJ/mol higher binding energy per nucleotide compared to a positive sense RNA. This energy difference produces a binding energy high enough to make the negative sense RNA, the preferred substrate for packaging by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of cellular or complementary positive sense RNAs. The outcome of this study may contribute to ongoing researches on other viral diseases caused by negative sense RNA viruses such as Ebola virus which poses a security threat to all humanity.",0,"Mechanism of Preferential Packaging of Negative Sense Genomic RNA by Viral Nucleoproteins in Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus The Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an infectious disease of high virulence and mortality caused by a negative sense RNA nairovirus.

Comparison of clinical outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgery for left-sided colon cancer: a nationwide population-based study,"The role of laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer has been supported by the results of randomized controlled trials. However, its benefits and disadvantages in the real world setting should be further assessed with population-based studies.The hospitalization data of patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer were sourced from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patient and hospital characteristics and perioperative outcomes including length of hospital stay, operation time, opioid use, blood transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and use of mechanical ventilation were compared. The overall survival was also assessed. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery had shorter hospital stay (p < 0.0001) and less demand for opioid analgesia (p = 0.0005). Further logistic regression revealed that patients undergoing open surgery were 1.70, 2.89, and 3.00 times more likely to have blood transfusion, to be admitted to ICU, and to use mechanical ventilation than patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Operations performed in medical centers were also associated with less adverse events. The overall survival was comparable between the 2 groups.With adequate hospital quality and volume, laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer was associated with improved perioperative outcomes.

"The SENIEUR protocol and the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination in healthy elderly persons by age, gender, and vaccine route","BACKGROUND: Reduced response to hepatitis B vaccines is associated with aging, confounding and comorbid conditions, as well as inadvertent subcutaneous (SC) inoculation. We hypothesized that the antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses (T-CMI) of elderly adults to a vaccine intended for intramuscular (IM) administration would be attenuated when deposited into SC fat, independent of confounding conditions. RESULTS: Fifty-two healthy, community dwelling elderly adults (65–82 years), seronegative for HBV, were enrolled in the SENIEUR protocol as a strictly healthy population. These seniors were randomized to receive a licensed alum-adjuvanted recombinant HBV vaccine either SC or IM, with the inoculum site verified by imaging. The response rates, defined as hepatitis B surface antibodies (HBsAb) ≥10 IU/L, were significantly lower in the elderly than in young adults, a group of 12, healthy, 21–34-year-old volunteers. Moreover, elderly participants who received the vaccine IM were significantly more likely to be responders than those immunized SC (54% versus 16%, p = 0.008). The low seroconversion rate in the IM group progressively declined with increasing age, and responders had significantly lower HBsAb titers and limited isotype responses. Moreover, T-CMI (proliferation and cytokine production) were significantly reduced in both percentage of responders and intensity of the response for both Th1 and Th2 subsets in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the blunted immunogenicity of SC inoculation as measured by peak titers and response rates. Further, the qualitative and quantitative deficits in B- and T-CMI responses to primary alum adjuvanted protein antigens persisted even in strictly healthy elderly populations with verified IM placement compared to younger populations.

An implantable system for long-term assessment of atrial fibrillation substrate in unanesthetized rats exposed to underlying pathological conditions,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive arrhythmia with underlying mechanisms that are not fully elucidated, partially due to lack of reliable and affordable animal models. Here, we introduce a system for long-term assessment of AF susceptibility (substrate) in ambulatory rats implanted with miniature electrodes on the atrium. Rats were subjected to excessive aldosterone (Aldo) or solvent only (Sham). An additional group was exposed to myocardial infarction (MI). AF substrate was tested two- and four-weeks post implantation and was also compared with implanted rats early post-implantation (Base). Aldo and MI increased the AF substrate and atrial fibrosis. In the MI group only, AF duration was correlated with the level of atrial fibrosis and was inversely correlated with systolic function. Unexpectedly, Shams also developed progressive AF substrate relative to Base individuals. Further studies indicated that serum inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were not elevated in the shams. In addition, we excluded anxiety\depression due to social-isolation as an AF promoting factor. Finally, enhanced biocompatibility of the atrial electrode did not inhibit the gradual development of AF substrate over a testing period of up to 8 weeks. Overall, we successfully validated the first system for long-term AF substrate testing in ambulatory rats.",0,"An implantable system for long-term assessment of atrial fibrillation substrate in unanesthetized rats exposed to underlying pathological conditions Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive arrhythmia with underlying mechanisms that are not fully elucidated, partially due to lack of reliable and affordable animal models.

Paving the way for precision medicine v2.0 in intensive care by profiling necroinflammation in biofluids,"Current clinical diagnosis is typically based on a combination of approaches including clinical examination of the patient, clinical experience, physiologic and/or genetic parameters, high-tech diagnostic medical imaging, and an extended list of laboratory values mostly determined in biofluids such as blood and urine. One could consider this as precision medicine v1.0. However, recent advances in technology and better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying disease will allow us to better characterize patients in the future. These improvements will enable us to distinguish patients who have similar clinical presentations but different cellular and molecular responses. Treatments will be able to be chosen more “precisely”, resulting in more appropriate therapy, precision medicine v2.0. In this review, we will reflect on the potential added value of recent advances in technology and a better molecular understanding of necrosis and inflammation for improving diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients. We give a brief overview on the mutual interplay between necrosis and inflammation, which are two crucial detrimental factors in organ and/or systemic dysfunction. One of the challenges for the future will thus be the cellular and molecular profiling of necroinflammation in biofluids. The huge amount of data generated by profiling biomolecules and single cells through, for example, different omic-approaches is needed for data mining methods to allow patient-clustering and identify novel biomarkers. The real-time monitoring of biomarkers will allow continuous (re)evaluation of treatment strategies using machine learning models.

The effects of smoking on adolescent trauma patients: a propensity-score-matched analysis,"PURPOSE: Cigarettes have been demonstrated to be toxic to the pulmonary connective tissue by impairing the lung’s ability to clear debris, resulting in infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Approximately 8% of adolescents are smokers. We hypothesized that adolescent trauma patients who smoke have a higher rate of ARDS and pneumonia when compared to non-smokers. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2014–2016) was queried for adolescent trauma patients aged 13–17 years. Adolescent smokers were 1:2 propensity-score-matched to non-smokers based on age, comorbidities, and injury type. Data were analyzed using chi square for categorical data and Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data. RESULTS: From 32,610 adolescent patients, 997 (3.1%) were smokers. After matching, 459 smokers were compared to 918 non-smokers. There were no differences in matched characteristics. Compared to non-smokers, smokers had an increased rate of pneumonia (3.1% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.01) but not ARDS (0.2% vs. 0%, p = 0.16). Compared to the non-smoking group, the smokers had a longer median total hospital length-of-stay (3 vs. 2 days, p = 0.01) and no difference in overall mortality (1.5% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.29). CONCLUSION: Smoking is associated with an increased rate of pneumonia in adolescent trauma patients.

Drug2ways: Reasoning over causal paths in biological networks for drug discovery,"Elucidating the causal mechanisms responsible for disease can reveal potential therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention and, accordingly, guide drug repositioning and discovery. In essence, the topology of a network can reveal the impact a drug candidate may have on a given biological state, leading the way for enhanced disease characterization and the design of advanced therapies. Network-based approaches, in particular, are highly suited for these purposes as they hold the capacity to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. Here, we present drug2ways, a novel methodology that leverages multimodal causal networks for predicting drug candidates. Drug2ways implements an efficient algorithm which reasons over causal paths in large-scale biological networks to propose drug candidates for a given disease. We validate our approach using clinical trial information and demonstrate how drug2ways can be used for multiple applications to identify: i) single-target drug candidates, ii) candidates with polypharmacological properties that can optimize multiple targets, and iii) candidates for combination therapy. Finally, we make drug2ways available to the scientific community as a Python package that enables conducting these applications on multiple standard network formats.",0,"Drug2ways: Reasoning over causal paths in biological networks for drug discovery Elucidating the causal mechanisms responsible for disease can reveal potential therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention and, accordingly, guide drug repositioning and discovery.

Immunological aspects in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) development,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unique among B cell malignancies in that the malignant clones can be featured either somatically mutated or unmutated IGVH genes. CLL cells that express unmutated immunoglobulin variable domains likely underwent final development prior to their entry into the germinal center, whereas those that express mutated variable domains likely transited through the germinal center and then underwent final development. Regardless, the cellular origin of CLL remains unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize immunological aspects involved in this process and to provide insights about the complex biology and pathogenesis of this disease. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the origin of B-CLL clones into our current picture of normal B cell development. In particular, we suggest that unmutated CLL arises from normal B cells with self-reactivity for apoptotic bodies that have undergone receptor editing, CD5 expression, and anergic processes in the bone marrow. Similarly, mutated CLL would arise from cells that, while acquiring self-reactivity for autoantigens—including apoptotic bodies—in germinal centers, are also still subject to tolerization mechanisms, including receptor editing and anergy. We believe that CLL is a proliferation of B lymphocytes selected during clonal expansion through multiple encounters with (auto)antigens, despite the fact that they differ in their state of activation and maturation.

CLL cells that express unmutated immunoglobulin variable domains likely underwent final development prior to their entry into the germinal center, whereas those that express mutated variable domains likely transited through the germinal center and then underwent final development. Regardless, the cellular origin of CLL remains unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize immunological aspects involved in this process and to provide insights about the complex biology and pathogenesis of this disease. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the origin of B-CLL clones into our current picture of normal B cell development. In particular, we suggest that unmutated CLL arises from normal B cells with self-reactivity for apoptotic bodies that have undergone receptor editing, CD5 expression, and anergic processes in the bone marrow. Similarly, mutated CLL would arise from cells that, while acquiring self-reactivity for autoantigens—including apoptotic bodies—in germinal centers, are also still subject to tolerization mechanisms, including receptor editing and anergy. We believe that CLL is a proliferation of B lymphocytes selected during clonal expansion through multiple encounters with (auto)antigens, despite the fact that they differ in their state of activation and maturation.

"A pilot study—genetic diversity and population structure of snow leopards of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, using molecular techniques","BACKGROUND: The Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges in Pakistan’s northern areas are a natural habitat of the snow leopard (Panthera uncia syn. Uncia uncia) but the ecological studies on this animal are scarce since it is human shy by nature and lives in difficult mountainous tracts. The pilot study is conducted to exploit the genetic diversity and population structure of the snow leopard in this selected natural habitat of the member of the wildcat family in Pakistan. METHOD: About 50 putative scat samples of snow leopard from five localities of Gilgit-Baltistan (Pakistan) along with a control sample of zoo maintained male snow leopard were collected for comparison. Significant quality and quantity of genomic DNA was extracted from scat samples using combined Zhang–phenol–chloroform method and successful amplification of cytochrome c oxidase I gene (190 bp) using mini-barcode primers, seven simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers and Y-linked AMELY gene (200 bp) was done. RESULTS: Cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequencing suggested that 33/50 (66%) scat samples were of snow leopard. AMELY primer suggested that out of 33 amplified samples, 21 (63.63%) scats were from male and 12 (36.36%) from female leopards. Through successful amplification of DNA of 25 out of 33 (75.75%) scat samples using SSR markers, a total of 68 alleles on seven SSR loci were identified, showing low heterozygosity, while high gene flow between population. DISCUSSION: The low gene flow rate among the population results in low genetic diversity causing decreased diversification. This affects the adaptability to climatic changes, thus ultimately resulting in decreased population size of the species.",0,"A pilot study—genetic diversity and population structure of snow leopards of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, using molecular techniques BACKGROUND: The Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges in Pakistan’s northern areas are a natural habitat of the snow leopard (Panthera uncia syn.

Outcome measures in juvenile X-linked retinoschisis: A systematic review,"X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a leading cause of hereditary juvenile macular degeneration in males resulting in significant vision impairment. Outcome measures to monitor disease progression or therapeutic interventions have evolved with technology. A systematic review was undertaken to evaluate outcome measures for XLRS. Inclusion criteria were all publications examining outcome measures for natural history studies or following an interventional approach for patients with XLRS. Studies which did not present follow-up data were excluded. We searched medical databases including CENTRAL, Ovid Medline, pre-Medline and ahead of Print up to February 2019. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias. Twelve studies meet the inclusion criteria with four prospective and eight retrospective case series. Five series were natural history observational studies and seven were interventional series using either topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Visual acuity (VA) declined very slowly in the natural history studies equivalent to 0.22–0.5 letters per year. Five of the six interventional studies showed an improvement in VA and four a reduction in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) parameters for central macular thickness (CMT). The full-field electroretinogram identified the 30-Hz latency as a further parameter to monitor function. VA was the measure most likely to show a statistically significant outcome.

Interferon-γ Inhibits Ebola Virus Infection,"Ebola virus outbreaks, such as the 2014 Makona epidemic in West Africa, are episodic and deadly. Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available. Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option. Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection. As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication. Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes. Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection. These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection. As treatment of interferon gamma robustly protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, we propose that interferon gamma should be further evaluated for its efficacy as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategy against filoviruses.

The FDA-Approved Oral Drug Nitazoxanide Amplifies Host Antiviral Responses and Inhibits Ebola Virus,"Here, we show that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) broadly amplifies the host innate immune response to viruses and inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) replication. We find that NTZ enhances retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like-receptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, interferon regulatory factor 3, and interferon activities and induces transcription of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in human cells through its effects on RIG-I and protein kinase R (PKR), suggesting that it counteracts EBOV VP35 protein's ability to block RIG-I and PKR sensing of EBOV. NTZ also inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with VSV's distinct host innate immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, NTZ counteracts varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies by generally enhancing the RNA sensing and interferon axis that is triggered by foreign cytoplasmic RNA exposure, and holds promise as an oral therapy against EBOV.",0,"The FDA-Approved Oral Drug Nitazoxanide Amplifies Host Antiviral Responses and Inhibits Ebola Virus Here, we show that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) broadly amplifies the host innate immune response to viruses and inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) replication.

Regulation and Maintenance of an Adoptive T-Cell Dependent Memory B Cell Pool,"We investigated the ability of monoclonal B cells to restore primary and secondary T-cell dependent antibody responses in adoptive immune-deficient hosts. Priming induced B cell activation and expansion, AID expression, antibody production and the generation of IgM(+)IgG(-) and IgM(-)IgG(+) antigen-experienced B-cell subsets that persisted in the lymphopenic environment by cell division. Upon secondary transfer and recall the IgM(-)IgG(+) cells responded by the production of antigen-specific IgG while the IgM(+) memory cells secreted mainly IgM and little IgG, but generated new B cells expressing germinal center markers. The recall responses were more efficient if the antigenic boost was delayed suggesting that a period of adaptation is necessary before the transferred cells are able to respond. Overall these findings indicate that reconstitution of a functional and complete memory pool requires transfer of all different antigen-experienced B cell subsets. We also found that the size of the memory B cell pool did not rely on the number of the responding naïve B cells, suggesting autonomous homeostatic controls for naïve and memory B cells.

"TIM-1 serves as a receptor for Ebola virus in vivo, enhancing viremia and pathogenesis","BACKGROUND: T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor, mediating filovirus entry into cells through interactions with PS on virions. TIM-1 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein to demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Infectious, GFP-expressing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding either full length EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) or mucin domain deleted EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GPΔO/rVSV) was used to assess the role of TIM-1 during in vivo infection. GFP-expressing rVSV encoding its native glycoprotein G (G/rVSV) served as a control. TIM-1-sufficient or TIM-1-deficient BALB/c interferon α/β receptor(-/-) mice were challenged with these viruses. While G/rVSV caused profound morbidity and mortality in both mouse strains, TIM-1-deficient mice had significantly better survival than TIM-1-expressing mice following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPΔO/rVSV challenge. EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPΔO/rVSV in spleen of infected animals was high and unaffected by expression of TIM-1. However, infectious virus in serum, liver, kidney and adrenal gland was reduced late in infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. Consistent with higher virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more modestly affected. To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus. Depletion of T cells did not alter the pathogenic consequences of virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide evidence that at late times during EBOV GP/rVSV infection, TIM-1 increased virus load and associated mortality, consistent with an important role of this receptor in virus entry. This work suggests that inhibitors which block TIM-1/virus interaction may serve as effective antivirals, reducing virus load at late times during EBOV infection.",0,"TIM-1 serves as a receptor for Ebola virus in vivo, enhancing viremia and pathogenesis BACKGROUND: T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor, mediating filovirus entry into cells through interactions with PS on virions.

Is the Proteome of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Extracellular Vesicles a Marker of Advanced Lung Cancer?,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Bronchoalveolar lavage is routinely collected during bronchoscopy for cytology analysis in the diagnostic of lung cancer. Due to low sensitivity of this method, early-stage cancers are undetected, lowering the treatment success. In this study, we analyzed extracellular vesicles isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage of lung cancer suspects by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The protein composition of bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles of late-stage cancer showed a higher proteome complexity associated with mortality within the two year follow-up period. We identified a potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex which was significantly expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles as well as in tumor tissue. Bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles proteome analysis of immune markers indicates the presence of markers of innate immune and fibroblast cells. ABSTRACT: Acellular bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomics can partially separate lung cancer from non-lung cancer patients based on principal component analysis and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the variance in the proteomics data sets is correlated mainly with lung cancer status and, to a lesser extent, smoking status and gender. Despite these advances BAL small and large extracellular vehicles (EVs) proteomes reveal aberrant protein expression in paracrine signaling mechanisms in cancer initiation and progression. We consequently present a case-control study of 24 bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicle samples which were analyzed by state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We obtained evidence that BAL EVs proteome complexity correlated with lung cancer stage 4 and mortality within two years´ follow-up (p value = 0.006). The potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex is significantly up-regulated in tumor tissue and BAL EVs. The computational analysis of the immune and fibroblast cell markers in EVs suggests that patients who deceased within the follow-up period display higher marker expression indicative of innate immune and fibroblast cells (four out of five cases). This study provides insights into the proteome content of BAL EVs and their correlation to clinical outcomes.",0,"Is the Proteome of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Extracellular Vesicles a Marker of Advanced Lung Cancer?

The protein composition of bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles of late-stage cancer showed a higher proteome complexity associated with mortality within the two year follow-up period. We identified a potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex which was significantly expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles as well as in tumor tissue. Bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles proteome analysis of immune markers indicates the presence of markers of innate immune and fibroblast cells. ABSTRACT: Acellular bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomics can partially separate lung cancer from non-lung cancer patients based on principal component analysis and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the variance in the proteomics data sets is correlated mainly with lung cancer status and, to a lesser extent, smoking status and gender. Despite these advances BAL small and large extracellular vehicles (EVs) proteomes reveal aberrant protein expression in paracrine signaling mechanisms in cancer initiation and progression. We consequently present a case-control study of 24 bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicle samples which were analyzed by state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We obtained evidence that BAL EVs proteome complexity correlated with lung cancer stage 4 and mortality within two years´ follow-up (p value = 0.006). The potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex is significantly up-regulated in tumor tissue and BAL EVs. The computational analysis of the immune and fibroblast cell markers in EVs suggests that patients who deceased within the follow-up period display higher marker expression indicative of innate immune and fibroblast cells (four out of five cases). This study provides insights into the proteome content of BAL EVs and their correlation to clinical outcomes.",is the proteome of bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles a marker of advanced lung cancer simple summary bronchoalveolar lavage is routinely collected during bronchoscopy for cytology analysis in the diagnostic of lung cancer due to low sensitivity of this method earlystage cancers are undetected lowering the treatment success in this study we analyzed extracellular vesicles isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage of lung cancer suspects by mass spectrometrybased proteomics the protein composition of bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles of latestage cancer showed a higher proteome complexity associated with mortality within the two year followup period we identified a potential therapeutic target dnmt3b complex which was significantly expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles as well as in tumor tissue bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles proteome analysis of immune markers indicates the presence of markers of innate immune and fibroblast cells abstract acellular bronchoalveolar lavage bal proteomics can partially separate lung cancer from nonlung cancer patients based on principal component analysis and multivariate analysis furthermore the variance in the proteomics data sets is correlated mainly with lung cancer status and to a lesser extent smoking status and gender despite these advances bal small and large extracellular vehicles evs proteomes reveal aberrant protein expression in paracrine signaling mechanisms in cancer initiation and progression we consequently present a casecontrol study of 24 bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicle samples which were analyzed by stateoftheart liquid chromatographymass spectrometry lcms we obtained evidence that bal evs proteome complexity correlated with lung cancer stage 4 and mortality within two years followup p value  0006 the potential therapeutic target dnmt3b complex is significantly upregulated in tumor tissue and bal evs the computational analysis of the immune and fibroblast cell markers in evs suggests that patients who deceased within the followup period display higher marker expression indicative of innate immune and fibroblast cells four out of five cases this study provides insights into the proteome content of bal evs and their correlation to clinical outcomes,1
"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3′-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells","Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21- to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3′-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.",0,"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3′-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction.

"Epidemic Models: Their Spread, Analysis and Invasions in Scale-Free Networks","The mission of this chapter is to introduce the concept of epidemic outbursts in network structures, especially in case of scale-free networks. The invasion phenomena of epidemics have been of tremendous interest among the scientific community over many years, due to its large scale implementation in real world networks. This chapter seeks to make readers understand the critical issues involved in epidemics such as propagation, spread and their combat which can be further used to design synthetic and robust network architectures. The primary concern in this chapter focuses on the concept of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) models with their implementation in scale-free networks, followed by developing strategies for identifying the damage caused in the network. The relevance of this chapter can be understood when methods discussed in this chapter could be related to contemporary networks for improving their performance in terms of robustness. The patterns by which epidemics spread through groups are determined by the properties of the pathogen carrying it, length of its infectious period, its severity as well as by network structures within the population. Thus, accurately modeling the underlying network is crucial to understand the spread as well as prevention of an epidemic. Moreover, implementing immunization strategies helps control and terminate theses epidemics.",0,"Epidemic Models: Their Spread, Analysis and Invasions in Scale-Free Networks The mission of this chapter is to introduce the concept of epidemic outbursts in network structures, especially in case of scale-free networks.

Natural Compounds of Marine Origin as Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD): Potential Role for Cancer Interception and Therapy,"Regulated cell death (RCD) has always been considered a tolerogenic event. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurs as a consequence of tumour cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), triggering an immune response. ICD plays a major role in stimulating the function of the immune system in cancer during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. ICD can therefore represent one of the routes to boost anticancer immune responses. According to the recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (2018), apoptosis (type I cell death) and necrosis (type II cell death) represent are not the only types of RCD, which also includes necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and others. Specific downstream signalling molecules and death-inducing stimuli can regulate distinct forms of ICD, which develop and promote the immune cell response. Dying cells deliver different potential immunogenic signals, such as DAMPs, which are able to stimulate the immune system. The acute exposure of DAMPs can prime antitumour immunity by inducing activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), leading to the downstream response by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells (NK). As ICD represents an important target to direct and develop new pharmacological interventions, the identification of bioactive natural products, which are endowed with low side effects, higher tolerability and preferentially inducing immunogenic programmed cell death, represents a priority in biomedical research. The ability of ICD to drive the immune response depends on two major factors, neither of which is intrinsic to cell death: ‘Antigenicity and adjuvanticity’. Indeed, the use of natural ICD-triggering molecules, alone or in combination with different (immuno)therapies, can result in higher efficacy and tolerability. Here, we focused on natural (marine) compounds, particularly on marine microalgae derived molecules such as exopolysaccharides, sulphated polysaccharides, glycopeptides, glycolipids, phospholipids, that are endowed with ICD-inducing properties and sulfavants. Here, we discuss novel and repurposed small-molecule ICD triggers, as well as their ability to target important molecular pathways including the IL-6, TNF-α and interferons (IFNs), leading to immune stimulation, which could be used alone or in combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer prevention and therapies.",0,"Natural Compounds of Marine Origin as Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD): Potential Role for Cancer Interception and Therapy Regulated cell death (RCD) has always been considered a tolerogenic event.

A Novel Virus Causes Scale Drop Disease in Lates calcarifer,"From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia. The most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales. It was referred to as scale drop syndrome, but the etiology remained enigmatic. By using a next-generation virus discovery technique, VIDISCA-454, sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish. The near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined, which shows a unique genome organization, and low levels of identity to known members of the Iridoviridae. Based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins, the virus is a novel member of the Megalocytivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. The virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture, where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected Asian seabass kidney and brain cells. Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm, characteristic for the Iridoviridae. In vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in Asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish. These findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome, as each of Koch’s postulates is fulfilled. We have named the virus Scale Drop Disease Virus. Vaccines prepared from BEI- and formalin inactivated virus, as well as from E. coli produced major capsid protein provide efficacious protection against scale drop disease.",0,"A Novel Virus Causes Scale Drop Disease in Lates calcarifer From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia.

Impact of Model Shape Mismatch on Reconstruction Quality in Electrical Impedance Tomography,"Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a low-cost, noninvasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung. Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilator-induced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of EIT is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct EIT images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we, therefore, seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of four EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.",0,"Impact of Model Shape Mismatch on Reconstruction Quality in Electrical Impedance Tomography Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a low-cost, noninvasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung.

Avian influenza A H7N9 virus infects human astrocytes and neuronal cells and induces inflammatory immune responses,"Seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza virus infections may be associated with central nervous system pathology, albeit with varying frequency and different mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that differentiated human astrocytic (T98G) and neuronal (SH-SY5Y) cells can be infected by avian H7N9 and pandemic H1N1 viruses. However, infectious progeny viruses can only be detected in H7N9 virus infected human neuronal cells. Neither of these viral strains can generate infectious progeny virus in human astrocytes despite replication of viral genome was observed. Furthermore, H7N9 virus triggered high pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, while pandemic H1N1 virus induced only low cytokine expression in either brain cell type. The experimental finding here is the first data to demonstrate that avian H7N9 virus can infect, transcribe, and replicate its viral genome; induce cytokine upregulation; and cause cytopathic effects in human brain cells, which may potentially lead to profound central nervous system injury.

The electronic microscopy of various cell cultures (KCT, Vero, and MDCK) treated with nanoparticle solutions (20 µg/µl) showed that nanoparticles could enter the cells and accumulate in the vacuoles and phagosomes and form inclusions in cytoplasm.

Nanomedicine-based immunotherapy for central nervous system disorders,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders represent a broad spectrum of brain ailments with short- and long-term disabilities, and nanomedicine-based approaches provide a new therapeutic approach to treating CNS disorders. A variety of potential drugs have been discovered to treat several neuronal disorders; however, their therapeutic success can be limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, unique immune functions within the CNS provide novel target mechanisms for the amelioration of CNS diseases. Recently, various therapeutic approaches have been applied to fight brain-related disorders, with moderate outcomes. Among the various therapeutic strategies, nanomedicine-based immunotherapeutic systems represent a new era that can deliver useful cargo with promising pharmacokinetics. These approaches exploit the molecular and cellular targeting of CNS disorders for enhanced safety, efficacy, and specificity. In this review, we focus on the efficacy of nanomedicines that utilize immunotherapy to combat CNS disorders.

A variety of potential drugs have been discovered to treat several neuronal disorders; however, their therapeutic success can be limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, unique immune functions within the CNS provide novel target mechanisms for the amelioration of CNS diseases. Recently, various therapeutic approaches have been applied to fight brain-related disorders, with moderate outcomes. Among the various therapeutic strategies, nanomedicine-based immunotherapeutic systems represent a new era that can deliver useful cargo with promising pharmacokinetics.

Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus,"Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists. Canine distemper is a multi-host carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). The described cell receptor of CDV is SLAM (CD150). Attachment of CDV hemagglutinin protein (CDV-H) to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein (CDV-F). We investigated whether CDV strains co-evolved in the large, homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits, and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the SLAM binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from Canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families. Using an in vitro assay, we quantified syncytia formation mediated by CDV-H proteins from dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing dog, lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog SLAM than with cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types, but lower values in cells expressing dog SLAM than the values obtained for CDV-H proteins from dog strains. By experimentally changing one amino acid (Y549H) in the CDV-H protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits, thereby confirming its functional importance. A virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog SLAM than cells expressing SLAM of non-dog hosts, which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry. We provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by CDV strains, and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy. These findings extend knowledge on CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.",0,"Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists.

Reassessing therapeutic antibodies for neglected and tropical diseases,"In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators. The discovery of these new medicines has been driven primarily by new approaches in inflammatory diseases and oncology, especially in immuno-oncology. Other recent successes have included new antibodies for use in viral diseases, including HIV. The perception of very high costs associated with mAbs has led to the assumption that they play no role in prophylaxis for diseases of poverty. However, improvements in antibody-expression yields and manufacturing processes indicate this is a cost-effective option for providing protection from many types of infection that should be revisited. Recent technology developments also indicate that several months of protection could be achieved with a single dose. Moreover, new methods in B cell sorting now enable the systematic identification of high-quality antibodies from humanized mice, or patients. This Review discusses the potential for passive immunization against schistosomiasis, fungal infections, dengue, and other neglected diseases.",0,"Reassessing therapeutic antibodies for neglected and tropical diseases In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators.

Consumer acceptance among Dutch and German students of insects in feed and food,"Due to the environmental and nutritional benefits of insects, their consumption would be one of the solutions to feed the growing human population. Despite the increasing interest in the use of insects as food and feed, consumer acceptance is the major obstacle to successful implementation in Western countries and we studied the factors that influence consumer acceptance in a group of university students from Germany and the Netherlands. In this exploratory research, a survey was conducted (n = 222). Socio‐demographic and psychological factors were established from a theoretical review. In addition, we elaborated on questions regarding information on the health and environmental benefits of consuming insects. Initially, the data obtained are presented through descriptive statistics. The influence of the socio‐demographic and psychological factors, and the information on the willingness to accept insects as animal feed and human food was analyzed using correlations and multiple linear regressions. Results showed more willingness to accept insects as animal feed than in human food. The acceptance among German and Dutch students seems to be driven by issues similar to those in other European countries, such as visual aspects and knowledge about the benefits. The effect of the information on willingness constitutes an important finding of this study, especially for the use of insects in animal feed, since most of the previous studies have focused on the use of insects as human food. Our data support the need to inform and educate consumers about the environmental and health benefits of entomophagy. We conclude that effective efforts to implement entomophagy could increase the level of familiarity with the insect food and inform (or educate) consumers about its benefits. Insights from this study are useful to address studies focusing on specific segments of possible early adopters and consequently addressing communication strategies in this market segmentation.",0,"Consumer acceptance among Dutch and German students of insects in feed and food Due to the environmental and nutritional benefits of insects, their consumption would be one of the solutions to feed the growing human population.

An automated aquatic rack system for rearing marine invertebrates,"BACKGROUND: One hundred years ago, marine organisms were the dominant systems for the study of developmental biology. The challenges in rearing these organisms outside of a marine setting ultimately contributed to a shift towards work on a smaller number of so-called model systems. Those animals are typically non-marine organisms with advantages afforded by short life cycles, high fecundity, and relative ease in laboratory culture. However, a full understanding of biodiversity, evolution, and anthropogenic effects on biological systems requires a broader survey of development in the animal kingdom. To this day, marine organisms remain relatively understudied, particularly the members of the Lophotrochozoa (Spiralia), which include well over one third of the metazoan phyla (such as the annelids, mollusks, flatworms) and exhibit a tremendous diversity of body plans and developmental modes. To facilitate studies of this group, we have previously described the development and culture of one lophotrochozoan representative, the slipper snail Crepidula atrasolea, which is easy to rear in recirculating marine aquaria. Lab-based culture and rearing of larger populations of animals remain a general challenge for many marine organisms, particularly for inland laboratories. RESULTS: Here, we describe the development of an automated marine aquatic rack system for the high-density culture of marine species, which is particularly well suited for rearing filter-feeding animals. Based on existing freshwater recirculating aquatic rack systems, our system is specific to the needs of marine organisms and incorporates robust filtration measures to eliminate wastes, reducing the need for regular water changes. In addition, this system incorporates sensors and associated equipment for automated assessment and adjustment of water quality. An automated feeding system permits precise delivery of liquid food (e.g., phytoplankton) throughout the day, mimicking real-life feeding conditions that contribute to increased growth rates and fecundity. CONCLUSION: This automated system makes laboratory culture of marine animals feasible for both large and small research groups, significantly reducing the time, labor, and overall costs needed to rear these organisms.",0,"An automated aquatic rack system for rearing marine invertebrates BACKGROUND: One hundred years ago, marine organisms were the dominant systems for the study of developmental biology.

Hooked on virtual social life. Problematic social media use and associations with mental distress and addictive disorders,"BACKGROUND: Social media is an important and growing part of the lives of the vast majority of the global population, especially in the young. Although still a young and scarce subject, research has revealed that social media has addictive potential. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the associations between problematic use of social media and mental distress, problematic gaming and gambling, within the Swedish general population. METHODS: Data from 2,118 respondents was collected through self-report questions on demographics and validated scales measuring addiction-like experiences of social media, problem gaming, problem gambling, and mental distress. Associations were analyzed in unadjusted analyses and–for variables not exceedingly inter-correlated–in adjusted logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, problematic use of social media demonstrated a relationship with younger age, time using instant messaging services, and mental distress, but not with education level, occupational status, or with treatment needs for alcohol or drug problems. Behavioral addictions (internet, gaming and gambling) were substantially inter-correlated, and all were associated with problematic use of social media in unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Social media use is associated with other addictive behaviors and mental distress. While factors of causality remain to be studied, these insights can motivate healthcare professionals to assess social media habits, for example in individuals suffering from issues concerning gambling, gaming or mental health.",0,"Hooked on virtual social life.

OBJECTIVES: To describe methodological issues, experienced challenges related to data collection in North Macedonia and to discuss possible improvements of epidemiological data collection in future studies. SETTING: Clinic for Traumatology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia, Reanimation, Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Center, Mother Teresa Skopje University Hospital, Skopje and community settings, North Macedonia. METHOD: A description of methodological challenges experienced in collecting data from 78 persons with acute and chronic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) examined and interviewed in 2015–2017 using a semiquantitative questionnaire and standard assessments tools. RESULTS: This study identified three major challenges with data collection in this setting: (1) research logistics and procedures, such as recruitment, infrastructure, and compensation, (2) ethical issues and the initial lack of mutual trust and understanding between researchers and participants, and (3) scientific quality and interpretation, including representativeness. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological issues influenced by settings, are important to consider when interpreting study results. Healthcare systems vary between (and sometimes in) countries, language and culture may introduce barriers to understanding, and epidemiological research also rely on infrastructure and surroundings.

Measles Virus as an Oncolytic Immunotherapy,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Measles virus is currently under investigation as an innovative cancer treatment. The virus selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. Furthermore, it can be genetically engineered to increase tumor specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, treatment with measles virus activates antitumor immune responses. A number of clinical trials using measles virus for cancer treatment have been completed or are ongoing. Future studies will further harness the possibilities of virus engineering and potential of combination immunotherapies to improve clinical outcome. ABSTRACT: Measles virus (MeV) preferentially replicates in malignant cells, leading to tumor lysis and priming of antitumor immunity. Live attenuated MeV vaccine strains are therefore under investigation as cancer therapeutics. The versatile MeV reverse genetics systems allows for engineering of advanced targeted, armed, and shielded oncolytic viral vectors. Therapeutic efficacy can further be enhanced by combination treatments. An emerging focus in this regard is combination immunotherapy, especially with immune checkpoint blockade. Despite challenges arising from antiviral immunity, availability of preclinical models, and GMP production, early clinical trials have demonstrated safety of oncolytic MeV and yielded promising efficacy data. Future clinical trials with engineered viruses, rational combination regimens, and comprehensive translational research programs will realize the potential of oncolytic immunotherapy.",0,"Measles Virus as an Oncolytic Immunotherapy SIMPLE SUMMARY: Measles virus is currently under investigation as an innovative cancer treatment.

The social benefits of private infectious disease-risk mitigation,"Does society benefit from private measures to mitigate infectious disease risks? Since mitigation reduces both peak prevalence and the number of people who fall ill, the answer might appear to be yes. But mitigation also prolongs epidemics and therefore the time susceptible people engage in activities to avoid infection. These avoidance activities come at a cost—in lost production or consumption, for example. Whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness avoidance, now and into the future. We show that, for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially beneficial. However, in cases where society discounts the future at either very low or very high rates relative to private individuals, or where it places a low weight on the private cost of illness, the social cost of illness under proportionate mixing (doing nothing) may be lower than the social cost of illness under preferential mixing (avoiding infectious individuals). That is, under some circumstances, society would prefer shorter, more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer, less intense epidemics with avoidance costs. A sobering (although not surprising) implication of this is that poorer societies should be expected to promote less private disease-risk mitigation than richer societies.",0,"The social benefits of private infectious disease-risk mitigation Does society benefit from private measures to mitigate infectious disease risks?

Whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness avoidance, now and into the future. We show that, for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially beneficial. However, in cases where society discounts the future at either very low or very high rates relative to private individuals, or where it places a low weight on the private cost of illness, the social cost of illness under proportionate mixing (doing nothing) may be lower than the social cost of illness under preferential mixing (avoiding infectious individuals). That is, under some circumstances, society would prefer shorter, more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer, less intense epidemics with avoidance costs. A sobering (although not surprising) implication of this is that poorer societies should be expected to promote less private disease-risk mitigation than richer societies.",the social benefits of private infectious diseaserisk mitigation does society benefit from private measures to mitigate infectious disease risks since mitigation reduces both peak prevalence and the number of people who fall ill the answer might appear to be yes but mitigation also prolongs epidemics and therefore the time susceptible people engage in activities to avoid infection these avoidance activities come at a costin lost production or consumption for example whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness avoidance now and into the future we show that for a large class of infectious diseases private risk mitigation is socially beneficial however in cases where society discounts the future at either very low or very high rates relative to private individuals or where it places a low weight on the private cost of illness the social cost of illness under proportionate mixing doing nothing may be lower than the social cost of illness under preferential mixing avoiding infectious individuals that is under some circumstances society would prefer shorter more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer less intense epidemics with avoidance costs a sobering although not surprising implication of this is that poorer societies should be expected to promote less private diseaserisk mitigation than richer societies,1
Cardioprotective mechanisms of salvianic acid A sodium in rats with myocardial infarction based on proteome and transcriptome analysis,"Ischemic heart diseases (IHDs) cause great morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating effective treatment. Salvianic acid A sodium (SAAS) is an active compound derived from the well-known herbal medicine Danshen, which has been widely used for clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. This study aimed to confirm the cardioprotective effects of SAAS in rats with myocardial infarction and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms based on proteome and transcriptome profiling of myocardial tissue. The results showed that SAAS effectively protected against myocardial injury and improved cardiac function. The differentially expressed proteins and genes included important structural molecules, receptors, transcription factors, and cofactors. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that SAAS participated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, phagosome, focal adhesion, tight junction, apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and Wnt signaling pathways, which are closely related to cardiovascular diseases. SAAS may exert its cardioprotective effect by targeting multiple pathways at both the proteome and transcriptome levels. This study has provided not only new insights into the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction but also a road map of the cardioprotective molecular mechanisms of SAAS, which may provide pharmacological evidence to aid in its clinical application.",0,"Cardioprotective mechanisms of salvianic acid A sodium in rats with myocardial infarction based on proteome and transcriptome analysis Ischemic heart diseases (IHDs) cause great morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating effective treatment.

Genomic investigation of piglet resilience following porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes malabsorptive watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes in pigs. Since the 1970s, PED outbreaks have become a source of problems in pig producing countries all over the world, causing large economic losses for pig producers. Although the infection in adults is not fatal, in naïve suckling piglets mortality is close to 100%. In this study, we investigated genome‐wide differences between dead and recovered suckling piglets from commercial farms after PED outbreaks. Samples from 262 animals (156 dead and 106 recovered) belonging to several commercial lines were collected from five different farms in three different countries (USA, Canada and Germany) and genotyped with the porcine 80K SNP chip. Mean F (st) value was calculated in 1‐Mb non‐overlapping windows between dead and recovered individuals, and the results were normalized to find differences within the comparison. Seven windows with high divergence between dead and recovered were detected—five on chromosome 2, one on chromosome 4 and one on chromosome 15—in total encompassing 152 genes. Several of these genes are either under‐ or overexpressed in many virus infections, including Coronaviridae (such as SARS‐CoV). A total of 32 genes are included in one or more Gene Ontology terms that can be related to PED development, such as Golgi apparatus, as well as mechanisms generally linked to resilience or diarrhea development (cell proliferation, ion transport, ATPase activity). Taken together this information provides a first genomic picture of PEDV resilience in suckling piglets.",0,"Genomic investigation of piglet resilience following porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes malabsorptive watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes in pigs.

Modified ELISPOT: Modifications of the Elispot Assay for T Cell Monitoring in Cancer Vaccine Trials,"The use of the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay to evaluate cellular immune responses has gained increasing popularity, especially as a surrogate measure for CTL responses. We developed and validated some modifications of the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay to optimize immunological monitoring of various cancer vaccine trials. Taking into consideration that the main mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity is the release of cytolytic granules that contain, among others, cytolytic protein Granzyme B (GrB), we developed the GrB ELISPOT assay. Extensive studies demonstrated that the GrB ELISPOT assay is specific, accurately measures the rapid release of GrB, is more sensitive than the 51Cr-release assay, and that it may be successfully applied to measuring CTL precursory frequency in PBMC from cancer patients. Assuming that immunological assays that demonstrate recognition of native tumor cells (tumor-specific) may be more clinically relevant than assays that demonstrate recognition of tumor protein or peptide (antigen-specific), we developed and validated the Autologous Tumor IFN-γ ELISPOT assay using PBMC from idiotype vaccinated lymphoma patients as effectors and autologous B cell lymphoma tumor cells as targets. The precursor frequency of tumor-reactive T cells was significantly higher in the postvaccine PBMC, compared with prevaccine samples in all patients tested. Furthermore, the specificity of these T cells was established by the lack of reactivity against autologous normal B cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility of evaluating tumor-specific T cell responses when autologous, primary tumor cells are available as targets. Modifications of ELISPOT assay described in this chapter allow more comprehensive assessment of low frequency tumor-specific CTL and their specific effector functions and can provide valuable insight with regards to immune responses in cancer vaccine trials.",0,"Modified ELISPOT: Modifications of the Elispot Assay for T Cell Monitoring in Cancer Vaccine Trials The use of the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay to evaluate cellular immune responses has gained increasing popularity, especially as a surrogate measure for CTL responses.

Humans disrupt access to prey for large African carnivores,"Wildlife respond to human presence by adjusting their temporal niche, possibly modifying encounter rates among species and trophic dynamics that structure communities. We assessed wildlife diel activity responses to human presence and consequential changes in predator-prey overlap using 11,111 detections of 3 large carnivores and 11 ungulates across 21,430 camera trap-nights in West Africa. Over two-thirds of species exhibited diel responses to mainly diurnal human presence, with ungulate nocturnal activity increasing by 7.1%. Rather than traditional pairwise predator-prey diel comparisons, we considered spatiotemporally explicit predator access to several prey resources to evaluate community-level trophic responses to human presence. Although leopard prey access was not affected by humans, lion and spotted hyena access to three prey species significantly increased when prey increased their nocturnal activity to avoid humans. Human presence considerably influenced the composition of available prey, with implications for prey selection, demonstrating how humans perturb ecological processes via behavioral modifications.",0,"Humans disrupt access to prey for large African carnivores Wildlife respond to human presence by adjusting their temporal niche, possibly modifying encounter rates among species and trophic dynamics that structure communities.

"Vaccination coverage with the pneumococcal and influenza vaccine among persons with chronic diseases in Shanghai, China, 2017","BACKGROUND: Adults with chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease are more likely to develop complications from a number of vaccine-preventable diseases, including influenza and pneumonia. In this study, we use the data from a chronic disease management information system in Shanghai to estimate vaccination coverage and characterize predictors of seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) vaccination among people with chronic disease in Shanghai. METHODS: The Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have information systems related to chronic disease management, hospital records, and immunizations. Data from individuals with hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were abstracted during July 2017. The main outcome was coverage of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Vaccination coverage was calculated across demographic groups. Significance in bivariate associations was assessed through Pearson’s chi-square tests, and in multivariable models through logistic regression models with a forward stepwise method to select variables. RESULTS: In the sample of 2,531,227 individuals ≥15 years, 22.8% were vaccinated for pneumonia from January 2013 to July 2017, and the vaccination coverage of influenza in the 2016/17 influenza season was 0.4%. Vaccination coverage was highest in those 70–79 and lowest in those younger than 60. Compared to urban areas, uptake in rural areas was higher for pneumonia vaccination (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 2.41, 2.45), but lower for influenza vaccination (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.59).

"Molecular Detection, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Identification of Transcription Motifs in Feline Leukemia Virus from Naturally Infected Cats in Malaysia","A nested PCR assay was used to determine the viral RNA and proviral DNA status of naturally infected cats. Selected samples that were FeLV-positive by PCR were subjected to sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and motifs search. Of the 39 samples that were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 87.2% (34/39) were confirmed positive with nested PCR. FeLV proviral DNA was detected in 38 (97.3%) of p27-antigen negative samples. Malaysian FeLV isolates are found to be highly similar with a homology of 91% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates divided into two clusters, with a majority (86.2%) sharing similarity with FeLV-K01803 and fewer isolates (13.8%) with FeLV-GM1 strain. Different enhancer motifs including NF-GMa, Krox-20/WT1I-del2, BAF1, AP-2, TBP, TFIIF-beta, TRF, and TFIID are found to occur either in single, duplicate, triplicate, or sets of 5 in different positions within the U3-LTR-gag region. The present result confirms the occurrence of FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA in naturally infected cats. Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly similar, and a majority of them are closely related to a UK isolate. This study provides the first molecular based information on FeLV in Malaysia.

Of the 39 samples that were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 87.2% (34/39) were confirmed positive with nested PCR. FeLV proviral DNA was detected in 38 (97.3%) of p27-antigen negative samples. Malaysian FeLV isolates are found to be highly similar with a homology of 91% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates divided into two clusters, with a majority (86.2%) sharing similarity with FeLV-K01803 and fewer isolates (13.8%) with FeLV-GM1 strain. Different enhancer motifs including NF-GMa, Krox-20/WT1I-del2, BAF1, AP-2, TBP, TFIIF-beta, TRF, and TFIID are found to occur either in single, duplicate, triplicate, or sets of 5 in different positions within the U3-LTR-gag region. The present result confirms the occurrence of FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA in naturally infected cats.

Artificial MicroRNA-Mediated Inhibition of Japanese Encephalitis Virus Replication in Neuronal Cells,"Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated inhibition of viral replication has recently gained importance as a strategy for antiviral therapy. In this study, we evaluated the benefit of using the amiRNA vector against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). We designed three single amiRNA sequences against the consensus sequence of 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of JEV and tested their efficacy against cell culture-grown JEV Vellore strain (P20778) in neuronal cells. The binding ability of three amiRNAs on 3′UTR region was tested in vitro in HEK293T cells using a JEV 3′UTR tagged with luciferase reporter vector. Transient transfection of amiRNAs was nontoxic to cells as evident from the MTT assay and caused minimal induction in interferon-stimulated gene expression. Furthermore, our result suggested that transient expression of two amiRNAs (amiRNA #1 and amiRNA #2) significantly reduced intracellular viral RNA and nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein, as well as diminished infectious viral particle release up to 95% in the culture supernatant as evident from viral plaque reduction assay. Overall, our results indicated that RNA interference based on amiRNAs targeting viral conserved regions at 3′UTR was a useful approach for improvements of nucleic acid inhibitors against JEV.",0,"Artificial MicroRNA-Mediated Inhibition of Japanese Encephalitis Virus Replication in Neuronal Cells Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated inhibition of viral replication has recently gained importance as a strategy for antiviral therapy.

THE LABORATORY SELECTION OF ANTIVIRAL AGENTS,"The major disease targets for antiviral chemotherapy are influenza, rhinovirus colds and herpetic infections Some success has been achieved against influenza with 1-amino adamantane (amantadine), and several new alicyclic amines are at the development stage. There are many organic compounds, covering a wide range of chemical types, which will inhibit very effectively most or all strains of rhinovirus in vitro, but all have failed to inhibit significantly disease development in infected human volunteers. Most success has been achieved with anti-herpetic drugs, and a variety of nucleoside analogues ar now available for clinical use. Primary testing methods for potential antiviral agents rely on high-through-put methods for detecting inhibition of virus replication in cell cultures. Secondary screening of active compounds is often done in organ culture e.g. tracheal tissue explants. In-vivo evaluation is done in animal models of the human disease, where available. Prolonged safety testing is required before human trials can be started.",0,"THE LABORATORY SELECTION OF ANTIVIRAL AGENTS The major disease targets for antiviral chemotherapy are influenza, rhinovirus colds and herpetic infections Some success has been achieved against influenza with 1-amino adamantane (amantadine), and several new alicyclic amines are at the development stage.

The expression of nicotinic receptor alpha7 during cochlear development,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 expression was examined in the developing and adult auditory system using mice that were modified through homologous recombination to coexpress either GFP (alpha7GFP) or Cre (alpha7Cre), respectively. The expression of alpha7GFP is first detected at embryonic (E) day E13.5 in cells of the spiral prominence. By E14.5, sensory regions including the putative outer hair cells and Deiters' cells express alpha7GFP as do solitary efferent fibers. This pattern diminishes after E16.5 in a basal to apex progression, as Hensen's cells and cells of the spiral ligament acquire alpha7GFP expression. At birth and thereafter alpha7GFP also identifies a subset of spiral ganglion cells whose processes terminate on inner hair cells. Efferent fibers identified by peripherin or calcitonin gene-related protein do not coexpress alpha7GFP. In addition to cochlear structures, there is strong expression of alpha7GFP by cells of the central auditory pathways including the ventral posterior cochlear nucleus, lateral lemniscus, central inferior colliculus, and the medial geniculate nucleus. Our findings suggest that alpha7 expression by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells has the potential to impact multiple auditory functions through mechanisms that are not traditionally attributed to this receptor.",0,"The expression of nicotinic receptor alpha7 during cochlear development Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 expression was examined in the developing and adult auditory system using mice that were modified through homologous recombination to coexpress either GFP (alpha7GFP) or Cre (alpha7Cre), respectively.

Lipopolysaccharide and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibit Interferon Signaling in Hepatocytes by Increasing Ubiquitin-Like Protease 18 (USP18) Expression,"Inflammation may be maladaptive to the control of viral infection when it impairs interferon (IFN) responses, enhancing viral replication and spread. Dysregulated immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a hallmark of chronic viral infections such as, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that expression of an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), ubiquitin-like protease (USP)18 is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses to IFN-α. We examined the ability of inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 to upregulate hepatocyte USP18 expression and blunt the IFN-α response. Human hepatoma cells and primary murine hepatocytes were treated with TNF-α/LPS/IL-6/IL-10 and USP18, phosphorylated (p)-STAT1 and myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1) expression was determined. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells and primary murine hepatocytes with LPS and TNF-α, but not IL-6 or IL-10, led to upregulated USP18 expression and induced an IFN-α refractory state, which was reversed by USP18 knockdown. Liver inflammation was induced in vivo using a murine model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury led to an induction of USP18 expression in liver tissue and promotion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF-α and LPS) but not others (IL-6 and IL-10) target USP18 expression and thus inhibit IFN signaling. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states. IMPORTANCE Inflammation may prevent the control of viral infection when it impairs the innate immune response, enhancing viral replication and spread. Blunted immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a common characteristic of chronic viral infections. Previous studies have shown that expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses. In this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via USP18 induction.

Early Warning Systems Defined,"This chapter defines and describes early warning systems (EWS) by examining structures and functions of EWS. The focus of this book is on climate change, but other hazards help to better illustrate and understand EWS in the context of climate change. These include hazards which manifest rapidly, such as tsunamis, as well as creeping hazards which manifest slowly, such as drought. The fundamental tenet is that each EWS needs to be viewed as a social process which often involves technical components embedded in their social context. That leads to a preference for a ‘First Mile’ approach for designing EWS, which involves communities from the beginning of developing an EWS, rather than a ‘Last Mile’ approach, which adds people and communities towards the end of the design process. By keeping people and communities at the centre of an EWS from the beginning, the EWS can contribute to daily life and livelihoods, thereby supporting wider disaster risk reduction and sustainable development endeavours, rather than being a separate system waiting to be triggered only when a hazard appears. Yet any EWS has limitations. Those limitations need to be recognised and overcome through other approaches, with possibilities being to consider ‘medium warning’ and ‘late warning’ systems rather than just early warning.",0,"Early Warning Systems Defined This chapter defines and describes early warning systems (EWS) by examining structures and functions of EWS.

Discovery of an ene-reductase for initiating flavone and flavonol catabolism in gut bacteria,"Gut microbial transformations of flavonoids, an enormous class of polyphenolic compounds abundant in plant-based diets, are closely associated with human health. However, the enzymes that initiate the gut microbial metabolism of flavones and flavonols, the two most abundant groups of flavonoids, as well as their underlying molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here, we discovered a flavone reductase (FLR) from the gut bacterium, Flavonifractor plautii ATCC 49531 (originally assigned as Clostridium orbiscindens DSM 6740), which specifically catalyses the hydrogenation of the C2–C3 double bond of flavones/flavonols and initiates their metabolism as a key step. Crystal structure analysis revealed the molecular basis for the distinct catalytic property of FLR. Notably, FLR and its widespread homologues represent a class of ene-reductases that has not been previously identified. Genetic and biochemical analyses further indicated the importance of FLR in gut microbial consumption of dietary and medicinal flavonoids, providing broader insight into gut microbial xenobiotic transformations and possible guidance for personalized nutrition and medicine.",0,"Discovery of an ene-reductase for initiating flavone and flavonol catabolism in gut bacteria Gut microbial transformations of flavonoids, an enormous class of polyphenolic compounds abundant in plant-based diets, are closely associated with human health.

Junín virus induces autophagy in human A549 cells,"Autophagy, a highly regulated degradative process that promotes cellular homeostasis, is increasingly recognised as a fundamental component of the cellular response against viral infection. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy during Junín virus (JUNV) multiplication using human A549 cells. We found that JUNV infection induces an increment of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, an accumulation of punctate pattern in RFP-LC3-transfected cells and the colocalisation of viral nucleoprotein and LC3 protein, suggesting autophagosome formation. JUNV infection also induced the degradation of the autophagy receptor p62, suggesting that complete autophagic flux was triggered. In addition, we showed that inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine significantly reduces viral multiplication. Moreover, viral yield was increased when autophagy was induced using rapamycin. Furthermore, JUNV infection induced the colocalisation of p62, ATG16, RAB5, RAB7A and LAMP1 with the autophagosomal LC3 protein. That suggests that phagosomes undergo the maturation process during viral infection. Finally, we demonstrated that siRNA experiments targeting essential autophagy genes (ATG5, ATG7 and Beclin 1) reduce viral protein synthesis and viral yield.

The 11th ISPPD (ISPPD-11) was held in Melbourne, Australia in April 2018 and the proceedings of the symposium are captured in this report. Twenty years on from the first ISPPD, there remain many challenges and unanswered questions such as the continued disparity in disease incidence in Indigenous populations, the slow roll-out of PCV in some regions such as Asia, the persisting burden of disease in adults, serotype replacement and diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. ISPPD-11 also put the spotlight on cutting-edge science including metagenomic, transcriptomic, microscopy, medical imaging and mathematical modelling approaches.

There is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely, the just-right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system, galaxy, and the rest of the universe. Moreover, when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life, it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least, the important, if not crucial components of terrestrial life so that life then blooms, when their fragments cruise the solar system, stars, and galaxies, and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons. It is no longer extraordinary to detect extraterrestrial solar systems. Moreover, since extra-solar system space exploration has commenced, this provides the problem of detecting life with enhanced achievability. Small organisms, which replicate outside of a living cell or host, would not be catalogued as viruses. How about viruses that cohabit with life? On the Earth, viruses are a major, if underestimated, condition of life – will that be the case elsewhere? Detection of extra-solar system viruses, if they exist, requires finding life, since viruses necessitate life to replicate. (It should be noted, though, that viruses could be detected through various types of portable ultra-microscopes, including Electron Microscopes (EM) (scanning and transmission) as well as Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM).) However, extra-solar system detection of life does not oblige that viruses exist ubiquitously. Viruses are important potential components of biospheres because of their multiple interactions and influence on evolution, although viruses are small and obligatory parasitic. In addition, nanotechnology – living or replicating nano-synthetic machine organisms might also be present out there, and require consideration as well. An imposing caveat is that, if found, could some extraterrestrial viruses and synthetic nanotechnological microorganisms infect humans? Possibly, intelligence and cognition may at times be contemporaneous with life. Concomitantly, life and viruses that may be detected, could well be impacted upon by intelligences existing on such exoplanets (and vice versa). Coming to an understanding of the plurality of extraterrestrial intelligence is an optimal objective, in order to avoid causing harm on exoplanets, as well as avoiding conflict and possible human devastation. This is especially the case if we encounter greatly advanced galactic-level civilizations, compared to terrestrial civilizations. Their machine and bionic technologies on the Dyson engineering civilization scale may be prominently superior to ours; their biological expertise may be similarly critically radical. For example, they may use viruses for purposes for which we are barely aware, and which could be utterly deadly for humans. A series of steps is being taken in space exploration. Scientists hypothesize and claim that types of life may be near the Earth, in the solar system, and outside the solar system, similar to ours in the sense that only such conditions, Goldilocks conditions, are key sine qua non requirements, based on our terrestrial chemistry and biochemistry. If detected within the solar system, will life or its remnants resemble terrestrial life? Outside the solar system a similar chauvinism exists, although the likelihood for life, in any event, remains probably low, according to more cautious approaches to the problem. The study of our solar system includes planets, asteroids, comets, and other planetesimals that have been in overall contiguity during several billion years; anthropomorphisms claims life consequently has been developing along terrestrial-type mechanisms. However, a non-anthropomorphic view would surmise, probably not, especially for extra-solar system locales. The prime warning and admonition in all these deliberations is the contamination and damage, which current and past practice and procedures has caused and continues, due to insufficient biocontainment concepts and technology to date. Advances in the development of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high capacity ultrafast quantum computers (QC) greatly enhance the sophisticated control and logical development of extra-solar system studies.

Ethical aspects of medical age assessment in the asylum process: a Swedish perspective,"According to European regulations and the legislations of individual member states, children who seek asylum have a different set of rights than adults in a similar position. To protect these rights and ensure rule of law, migration authorities are commonly required to assess the age of asylum seekers who lack reliable documentation, including through various medical methods. However, many healthcare professionals and other commentators consider medical age assessment to be ethically problematic. This paper presents a simplified and amended account of the main findings of a recent ethical analysis of medical age assessment in the asylum process commissioned by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. A number of ethical challenges related to conflicting goals, equality and fairness, autonomy and informed consent, privacy and integrity, and professional values and roles are identified and analysed. It is concluded that most of these challenges can be met, but that this requires a system where the assessment is sufficiently accurate and where adequate safeguards are in place. Two important ethical questions are found to warrant further analysis. The first is whether asylum seekers’ consent to the procedure can be considered genuinely voluntary. The second is whether and how medical age assessments could affect negative public attitudes towards asylum seekers or discriminatory societal views more generally.",0,"Ethical aspects of medical age assessment in the asylum process: a Swedish perspective According to European regulations and the legislations of individual member states, children who seek asylum have a different set of rights than adults in a similar position.

Role of the adaptive immune response in sepsis,"Sepsis is a syndrome of shock and dysfunction of multiple vital organs that is caused by an uncontrolled immune response to infection and has a high mortality rate. There are no therapies for sepsis, and it has become a global cause for concern. Advances in patient care and management now mean that most patients survive the initial hyper-inflammatory phase of sepsis but progress to a later immunosuppressed phase, where 30% of patients die due to secondary infection. Deficits in the adaptive immune response may play a major role in sepsis patient mortality. The adaptive immune response involves a number of cell types including T cells, B cells and dendritic cells, all with immunoregulatory roles aimed at limiting damage and returning immune homeostasis after infection or insult. However, in sepsis, adaptive immune cells experience cell death or exhaustion, meaning that they have defective effector and memory responses ultimately resulting in an ineffective or suppressed immune defence. CD4+ T cells seem to be the most susceptible to cell death during sepsis and have ensuing defective secretory profiles and functions. Regulatory T cells seem to evade apoptosis and contribute to the immune suppression observed with sepsis. Preclinical studies have identified a number of new targets for therapy in sepsis including anti-apoptotic agents and monoclonal antibodies aimed at reducing cell death, exhaustion and maintaining/restoring adaptive immune cell functions. While early phase clinical trials have demonstrated safety and encouraging signals for biologic effect, larger scale clinical trial testing is required to determine whether these strategies will prove effective in improving outcomes from sepsis.",0,"Role of the adaptive immune response in sepsis Sepsis is a syndrome of shock and dysfunction of multiple vital organs that is caused by an uncontrolled immune response to infection and has a high mortality rate.

IL-4/IL-13 polarization of macrophages enhances Ebola virus glycoprotein-dependent infection,"BACKGROUND: Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreaks, while sporadic, cause tremendous morbidity and mortality. No therapeutics or vaccines are currently licensed; however, a vaccine has shown promise in clinical trials. A critical step towards development of effective therapeutics is a better understanding of factors that govern host susceptibility to this pathogen. As macrophages are an important cell population targeted during virus replication, we explore the effect of cytokine polarization on macrophage infection. METHODS/MAIN FINDINGS: We utilized a BSL2 EBOV model virus, infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding EBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/EBOV GP) in place of its native glycoprotein. Macrophages polarized towards a M2-like anti-inflammatory state by combined IL-4 and IL-13 treatment were more susceptible to rVSV/EBOV GP, but not to wild-type VSV (rVSV/G), suggesting that EBOV GP-dependent entry events were enhanced by these cytokines. Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors that bind and internalize filoviruses demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 stimulated expression of the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN in human macrophages and addition of the competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhanced infection. Two murine DC-SIGN-like family members, SIGNR3 and SIGNR5, were upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in murine macrophages, but only SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting that murine SIGNR3 plays a similar role to human DC-SIGN. In vivo IL-4/IL-13 administration significantly increased virus-mediated mortality in a mouse model and transfer of ex vivo IL-4/IL-13-treated murine peritoneal macrophages into the peritoneal cavity of mice enhanced pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: These studies highlight the ability of macrophage polarization to influence EBOV GP-dependent virus replication in vivo and ex vivo, with M2a polarization upregulating cell surface receptor expression and thereby enhancing virus replication. Our findings provide an increased understanding of the host factors in macrophages governing susceptibility to filoviruses and identify novel murine receptors mediating EBOV entry.",0,"IL-4/IL-13 polarization of macrophages enhances Ebola virus glycoprotein-dependent infection BACKGROUND: Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreaks, while sporadic, cause tremendous morbidity and mortality.

Toll-Interacting Protein in Pulmonary Diseases. Abiding by the Goldilocks Principle,"TOLLIP (Toll-interacting protein) is an intracellular adaptor protein with diverse actions throughout the body. In a context- and cell type–specific manner, TOLLIP can function as an inhibitor of inflammation and endoplasmic-reticulum stress, an activator of autophagy, or a critical regulator of intracellular vacuole trafficking. The distinct functions of this protein have been linked to innate immune responses and lung epithelial-cell apoptosis. TOLLIP genetic variants have been associated with a variety of chronic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation, and with infections, such as tuberculosis, Legionella pneumonia, and respiratory viruses. TOLLIP exists in a delicate homeostatic balance, with both positive and negative effects on the trajectory of pulmonary diseases. This translational review summarizes the genetic and molecular associations that link TOLLIP to the development and progression of noninfectious and infectious pulmonary diseases. We highlight current limitations of in vitro and in vivo models in assessing the role of TOLLIP in these conditions, and we describe future approaches that will enable a more nuanced exploration of the role of TOLLIP in pulmonary conditions. There has been a surge in recent research evaluating the role of this protein in human diseases, but critical mechanistic pathways require further exploration. By understanding its biologic functions in disease-specific contexts, we will be able to determine whether TOLLIP can be therapeutically modulated to treat pulmonary diseases.",0,"Toll-Interacting Protein in Pulmonary Diseases.

GPVI (Glycoprotein VI) Interaction With Fibrinogen Is Mediated by Avidity and the Fibrinogen αC-Region,"OBJECTIVE: GPVI (glycoprotein VI) is a key molecular player in collagen-induced platelet signaling and aggregation. Recent evidence indicates that it also plays important role in platelet aggregation and thrombus growth through interaction with fibrin(ogen). However, there are discrepancies in the literature regarding whether the monomeric or dimeric form of GPVI binds to fibrinogen at high affinity. The mechanisms of interaction are also not clear, including which region of fibrinogen is responsible for GPVI binding. We aimed to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of interaction at molecular level and to identify the regions on fibrinogen important for GPVI binding. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using multiple surface- and solution-based protein-protein interaction methods, we observe that dimeric GPVI binds to fibrinogen with much higher affinity and has a slower dissociation rate constant than the monomer due to avidity effects. Moreover, our data show that the highest affinity interaction of GPVI is with the αC-region of fibrinogen. We further show that GPVI interacts with immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin variants at a similar level, including a nonpolymerizing fibrin variant, suggesting that GPVI binding is independent of fibrin polymerization. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above findings, we conclude that the higher affinity of dimeric GPVI over the monomer for fibrinogen interaction is achieved by avidity. The αC-region of fibrinogen appears essential for GPVI binding. We propose that fibrin polymerization into fibers during coagulation will cluster GPVI through its αC-region, leading to downstream signaling, further activation of platelets, and potentially stimulating clot growth.",0,"GPVI (Glycoprotein VI) Interaction With Fibrinogen Is Mediated by Avidity and the Fibrinogen αC-Region OBJECTIVE: GPVI (glycoprotein VI) is a key molecular player in collagen-induced platelet signaling and aggregation.

CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above findings, we conclude that the higher affinity of dimeric GPVI over the monomer for fibrinogen interaction is achieved by avidity. The αC-region of fibrinogen appears essential for GPVI binding. We propose that fibrin polymerization into fibers during coagulation will cluster GPVI through its αC-region, leading to downstream signaling, further activation of platelets, and potentially stimulating clot growth.",gpvi glycoprotein vi interaction with fibrinogen is mediated by avidity and the fibrinogen αcregion objective gpvi glycoprotein vi is a key molecular player in collageninduced platelet signaling and aggregation recent evidence indicates that it also plays important role in platelet aggregation and thrombus growth through interaction with fibrinogen however there are discrepancies in the literature regarding whether the monomeric or dimeric form of gpvi binds to fibrinogen at high affinity the mechanisms of interaction are also not clear including which region of fibrinogen is responsible for gpvi binding we aimed to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of interaction at molecular level and to identify the regions on fibrinogen important for gpvi binding approach and results using multiple surface and solutionbased proteinprotein interaction methods we observe that dimeric gpvi binds to fibrinogen with much higher affinity and has a slower dissociation rate constant than the monomer due to avidity effects moreover our data show that the highest affinity interaction of gpvi is with the αcregion of fibrinogen we further show that gpvi interacts with immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin variants at a similar level including a nonpolymerizing fibrin variant suggesting that gpvi binding is independent of fibrin polymerization conclusions based on the above findings we conclude that the higher affinity of dimeric gpvi over the monomer for fibrinogen interaction is achieved by avidity the αcregion of fibrinogen appears essential for gpvi binding we propose that fibrin polymerization into fibers during coagulation will cluster gpvi through its αcregion leading to downstream signaling further activation of platelets and potentially stimulating clot growth,1
Associations of osteopontin and NT-proBNP with circulating miRNA levels in acute coronary syndrome,"The genomic regulatory networks underlying the pathogenesis of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) are incompletely understood. As intermediate traits, protein biomarkers report on underlying disease severity and prognosis in NSTE-ACS. We hypothesized that integration of dense microRNA (miRNA) profiling with biomarker measurements would highlight potential regulatory pathways that underlie the relationships between prognostic biomarkers, miRNAs, and cardiovascular phenotypes. We performed miRNA sequencing using whole blood from 186 patients from the TRILOGY-ACS trial. Seven circulating prognostic biomarkers were measured: NH(2)-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, osteopontin (OPN), myeloperoxidase, growth differentiation factor 15, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and neopterin. We tested miRNAs for association with each biomarker with generalized linear models and controlled the false discovery rate at 0.05. Ten miRNAs, including known cardiac-related miRNAs 25-3p and 423-3p, were associated with NT-proBNP levels (min. P = 7.5 × 10(−4)) and 48 miRNAs, including cardiac-related miRNAs 378a-3p, 20b-5p and 320a, -b, and -d, were associated with OPN levels (min. P = 1.6 × 10(−6)). NT-proBNP and OPN were also associated with time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in the sample. By integrating large-scale miRNA profiling with circulating biomarkers as intermediate traits, we identified associations of known cardiac-related and novel miRNAs with two prognostic biomarkers and identified potential genomic networks regulating these biomarkers. These results, highlighting plausible biological pathways connecting miRNAs with biomarkers and outcomes, may inform future studies seeking to delineate genomic pathways underlying NSTE-ACS outcomes.",0,"Associations of osteopontin and NT-proBNP with circulating miRNA levels in acute coronary syndrome The genomic regulatory networks underlying the pathogenesis of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) are incompletely understood.

Upstream Disaster Management to Support People Experiencing Homelessness,"The unique context of day-to-day living for people who are chronically homeless or living with housing insecurity puts them at high risk during community disasters. The impacts of extreme events, such as flooding, storms, riots, and other sources of community disruption, underscore the importance of preparedness efforts and fostering community resilience. This study is part of larger initiative focused on enhancing resilience and preparedness among high risk populations. The purpose of this study was to explore critical issues and strategies to promote resilience and disaster preparedness among people who are homeless in Canada. A sample of interviews (n=21) from key informants across Canada was analyzed to explore existing programs and supports for homeless populations. The data was selected from a larger sample of (n=43) interviews focused on programs and supports for people who are at heightened risk for negative impacts during disasters. Qualitative content analysis was used to extract emergent themes and develop a model of multi-level collaboration to support disaster resilience among people who are homeless. The results indicate there is a need for more upstream continuity planning, collaboration and communication between the emergency management sector and community service organizations that support people who are homeless. Prioritization and investment in the social determinants of health and community supports is necessary to promote resilience among this high-risk population. The findings from this study highlight the importance of acknowledging community support organizations as assets in disaster preparedness. Day-to-day resilience is an ongoing theme for people who are chronically homeless or living with housing insecurity. Upstream investment to build adaptive capacity and collaborate with community organizations is an important strategy to enhance community resilience.",0,"Upstream Disaster Management to Support People Experiencing Homelessness The unique context of day-to-day living for people who are chronically homeless or living with housing insecurity puts them at high risk during community disasters.

Data-Driven Corrections of Partial Lotka–Volterra Models,"In many applications of interacting systems, we are only interested in the dynamic behavior of a subset of all possible active species. For example, this is true in combustion models (many transient chemical species are not of interest in a given reaction) and in epidemiological models (only certain subpopulations are consequential). Thus, it is common to use greatly reduced or partial models in which only the interactions among the species of interest are known. In this work, we explore the use of an embedded, sparse, and data-driven discrepancy operator to augment these partial interaction models. Preliminary results show that the model error caused by severe reductions—e.g., elimination of hundreds of terms—can be captured with sparse operators, built with only a small fraction of that number. The operator is embedded within the differential equations of the model, which allows the action of the operator to be interpretable. Moreover, it is constrained by available physical information and calibrated over many scenarios. These qualities of the discrepancy model—interpretability, physical consistency, and robustness to different scenarios—are intended to support reliable predictions under extrapolative conditions.",0,"Data-Driven Corrections of Partial Lotka–Volterra Models In many applications of interacting systems, we are only interested in the dynamic behavior of a subset of all possible active species.
