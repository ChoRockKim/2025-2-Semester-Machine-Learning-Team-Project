Predictors of Clinical Respiratory Virus Testing Among Adults Hospitalized with Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) (2015–2016),"BACKGROUND: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies require an accurate indicator of influenza infection, often obtained through research testing independent of clinical (physician-ordered) testing. Clinical testing could be used to detect influenza in these studies if factors associated with clinical testing for influenza were better understood. METHODS: Adults hospitalized with ARI at three study sites during the study period were enrolled in CDC’s 2015–16 Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) study and tested for influenza by RT-PCR. Clinical testing information, presenting symptoms, and patient characteristics were collected from medical records and patient interview. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds of receiving a clinical test based on age, vaccination status, comorbidities, presentation with influenza-like illness (ILI; defined as fever and cough or sore throat) and other factors. RESULTS: Of 895 enrollees, 571 (64%) patients meeting study inclusion criteria received physician-ordered testing. Of these, 53% had a multipathogen panel, 13% had a rapid antigen test, 7% had singleplex PCR, <1% had viral culture, and 27% had multiple tests; influenza infection was detected in 55 (6%) patients. Of 150 influenza cases identified by study testing, 25 (17%) were not tested clinically. Enrollees who did not receive clinical testing were older, had longer time to admission, and were less likely to present with ILI. Immunosuppressive disorders (aOR=2.05), non-COPD lung conditions (aOR=1.68), presentation with ILI (aOR=4.03), and admission ≤2 days from symptom onset (aOR=1.89) were positively associated with receiving a clinical test (P < 0.01 for all; Figure 1). After adjusting for these factors, enrollees with influenza vaccination were 37% less likely (aOR=0.63) to receive a clinical test (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with ARI who were clinically tested for influenza differed from those not tested. A lower likelihood of testing among influenza positive vaccinees could potentially bias VE estimates upward and requires further evaluation. Clinical testing alone may fail to detect a substantial proportion of influenza cases.

Counteraction of HCV-Induced Oxidative Stress Concurs to Establish Chronic Infection in Liver Cell Cultures,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen causing acute and chronic hepatitis. A significant number of people chronically infected with HCV develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of hepatocyte damage associated with chronic HCV infection are not fully understood yet, mainly due to the lack of an in vitro system able to recapitulate the stages of infection in vivo. Several studies underline that HCV virus replication depends on redox-sensitive cellular pathways; in addition, it is known that virus itself induces alterations of the cellular redox state. However, the exact interplay between HCV replication and oxidative stress has not been elucidated. In particular, the role of reduced glutathione (GSH) in HCV replication and infection is still not clear. We set up an in vitro system, based on low m.o.i. of Huh7.5 cell line with a HCV infectious clone (J6/JFH1), that reproduced the acute and persistent phases of HCV infection up to 76 days of culture. We demonstrated that the acute phase of HCV infection is characterized by the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated in part with an increase of NADPH-oxidase transcripts and activity and a depletion of GSH accompanied by high rates of viral replication and apoptotic cell death. Conversely, the chronic phase is characterized by a reestablishment of reduced environment due to a decreased ROS production and increased GSH content in infected cells that might concur to the establishment of viral persistence. Treatment with the prooxidant auranofin of the persistently infected cultures induced the increase of viral RNA titer, suggesting that a prooxidant state could favor the reactivation of HCV viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. Our results suggest that targeting the redox-sensitive host-cells pathways essential for viral replication and/or persistence may represent a promising option for contrasting HCV infection.",0,"Counteraction of HCV-Induced Oxidative Stress Concurs to Establish Chronic Infection in Liver Cell Cultures Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen causing acute and chronic hepatitis.

Addressing Minority Stress and Mental Health among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in China,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in China experience elevated risks of mental health issues in comparison to the general population in China, which contribute to vulnerability to HIV/STI risks and can comprise the effectiveness of HIV prevention efforts. A conceptual framework for understanding this mental health disparity is minority stress theory, which posits that experiences of external prejudice events (i.e., distal stressors) and internal stress processes such as internalized homophobia and concealment (i.e., proximal stressors) contribute to sexual minorities’ elevated risk of psychological distress. To deepen the understanding of mental health among Chinese MSM and explore the potential utility of minority stress theory in this population, this paper synthesizes research evidence regarding prevalent mental health issues as well as how minority stress may be linked to psychological health in Chinese MSM. RECENT FINDINGS: Results indicate that Chinese MSM experience a high prevalence of several mental health issues including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol dependence. SUMMARY: This review further reveals minority stress to be an important determinant of psychological distress among Chinese MSM, though evidence is mixed regarding the relationship between proximal minority stress and psychological health. Nonetheless, there is a lack of mental health services and interventions focusing on MSM in China. Culturally relevant, competent, and LGBT-affirmative mental health interventions are needed for Chinese MSM. To guide future intervention research, we provide considerations for reducing minority stress and promoting psychological health among Chinese MSM.",0,"Addressing Minority Stress and Mental Health among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in China PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in China experience elevated risks of mental health issues in comparison to the general population in China, which contribute to vulnerability to HIV/STI risks and can comprise the effectiveness of HIV prevention efforts.

"Aerosolized Exposure to H5N1 Influenza Virus Causes Less Severe Disease Than Infection via Combined Intrabronchial, Oral, and Nasal Inoculation in Cynomolgus Macaques","Infection with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus in humans often leads to severe respiratory disease with high mortality. Experimental infection in non-human primates can provide additional insight into disease pathogenesis. However, such a model should recapitulate the disease symptoms observed in humans, such as pneumonia and inflammatory cytokine response. While previous studies in macaques have demonstrated the occurrence of typical lesions in the lungs early after infection and a high level of immune activation, progression to severe disease and lethality were rarely observed. Here, we evaluated a routinely used combined route of infection via intra-bronchial, oral, and intra-nasal virus inoculation with aerosolized H5N1 exposure, with or without the regular collection of bronchoalveolar lavages early after infection. Both combined route and aerosol exposure resulted in similar levels of virus replication in nose and throat and similar levels of immune activation, cytokine, and chemokine release in the blood. However, while animals exposed to H5N1 by combined-route inoculation developed severe disease with high lethality, aerosolized exposure resulted in less lesions, as measured by consecutive computed tomography and less fever and lethal disease. In conclusion, not virus levels or immune activation, but route of infection determines fatal outcome for highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza infection.",0,"Aerosolized Exposure to H5N1 Influenza Virus Causes Less Severe Disease Than Infection via Combined Intrabronchial, Oral, and Nasal Inoculation in Cynomolgus Macaques Infection with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus in humans often leads to severe respiratory disease with high mortality.

Private collection: high correlation of sample collection and patient admission date in clinical microbiological testing complicates sharing of phylodynamic metadata,"Infectious pathogens are known for their rapid evolutionary rates with new mutations arising over days to weeks. The ability to rapidly recover whole genome sequences and analyze the spread and evolution of pathogens using genetic information and pathogen collection dates has lead to interest in real-time tracking of infectious transmission and outbreaks. However, the level of temporal resolution afforded by these analyses may conflict with definitions of what constitutes protected health information (PHI) and privacy requirements for de-identification for publication and public sharing of research data and metadata. In the United States, dates and locations associated with patient care that provide greater resolution than year or the first three digits of the zip code are generally considered patient identifiers. Admission and discharge dates are specifically named as identifiers in Department of Health and Human Services guidance. To understand the degree to which one can impute admission dates from specimen collection dates, we examined sample collection dates and patient admission dates associated with more than 270,000 unique microbiological results from the University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department between 2010 and 2017. Across all positive microbiological tests, the sample collection date exactly matched the patient admission date in 68.8% of tests. Collection dates and admission dates were identical from emergency department and outpatient testing 86.7% and 96.5% of the time, respectively, with >99% of tests collected within 1 day from the patient admission date. Samples from female patients were significantly more likely to be collected closer to admission date that those from male patients. We show that PHI-associated dates such as admission date can confidently be imputed from deposited collection date. We suggest that publicly depositing microbiological collection dates at greater resolution than the year may not meet routine Safe Harbor-based requirements for patient de-identification. We recommend the use of Expert Determination to determine PHI for a given study and/or direct patient consent if clinical laboratories or phylodynamic practitioners desire to make these data available.",0,"Private collection: high correlation of sample collection and patient admission date in clinical microbiological testing complicates sharing of phylodynamic metadata Infectious pathogens are known for their rapid evolutionary rates with new mutations arising over days to weeks.

Prediction of hospital outcome in emergency medical admissions using modified early warning score (MEWS): Indian experience,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the applicability of modified early warning (MEWS) Score for prediction of hospital outcomes of medical emergency patients. DESIGN: Prospective hospital based observational study. SETTING: A tertiary care level medicine emergency unit in a medical college of North India. STUDY POPULATION: 300 Patients admitted in medicine emergency. METHOD: Patients of both sexes of age more than 18 years who were admitted in medical emergency unit at MMIMSR, Ambala were evaluated. Patients who were in cardiac arrest at arrival and those who died within the first 24 hours were excluded and 300 patients were included. Modified Early Warning Score based on physiological parameters was recorded at admission for each patient and monitored over the next 24 hours in the emergency unit. Hospital outcome of the patient in terms of mortality, need for critical care, prolonged stay and uneventful discharge were recorded and correlated with MEWS scores over the first 24 hours in the emergency unit. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves was generated to evaluate the utility of MEWS as a tool to predict patient outcome in medical emergency setting. RESULT: Of the 300 patients studied, the mean age of patients was 49 years, and the majority of the patients were male (61%). A MEWS Score of >5 at 24 hours of admission was associated significantly with in-hospital mortality of patients (p < 0.0001). The ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve revealed that in those patients who had a 24 hours MEWS >/= 5, the area under curve was (AUC) = 0.9. (95% CI: 0.95-0.98). Thus, MEWS was an effective predictor of in hospital mortality with sensitivity (78%) and specificity (94%). CONCLUSION: MEWS, a scoring system based on easily recordable physiological parameters can be used as an effective tool to triage and monitor patients in medical emergency units, to identify patients who are at greater risk of clinical deterioration and need close monitoring or early transfer for critical care or other timely interventions. Thus, application of MEWS in medical emergency units can be a useful tool to improve patient care, ensure optimal utilization of resources and prevent inappropriate discharge or neglect of sick patients.",0,"Prediction of hospital outcome in emergency medical admissions using modified early warning score (MEWS): Indian experience OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the applicability of modified early warning (MEWS) Score for prediction of hospital outcomes of medical emergency patients.

Cytokine Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Severe Infectious Diseases,"Cytokines are key regulators of the host response to infection, controlling the inflammatory reaction which is an essential component of the defense mechanisms. The major importance of these proteins in the pathogenesis and outcome of infectious diseases has been clearly demonstrated. In humans, there is increasing evidence that the host's cytokine response is genetically determined and that the genetic variability of cytokines underlies the complexity of interindividual differences in the immune response to micro organism invasions. We review the influence of host cytokine gene on the susceptibility to and the severity of parasitic, bacterial and viral infections. Proinflammatory cytokine polymorphisms are discussed in detail because of their importance in the course of severe infections such as meningococcal disease, cerebral malaria and septic shock. Genetic variants of the IL-10 gene, an antiinflammatory cytokine appear to be responsible for an uncontrolled and intense CARS and may have also dramatic consequences as an overwhelming inflammatory response. Our greater understanding of the genetic factors that influence mortality and morbidity of infectious diseases will permit identification of genomic markers which may be required for risk stratification of patients targeted for novel immunomodulatory treatments helping clinicians to select the most appropriate treatment options for their patients.",0,"Cytokine Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Severe Infectious Diseases Cytokines are key regulators of the host response to infection, controlling the inflammatory reaction which is an essential component of the defense mechanisms.

Reverse Genetics Approaches for the Development of Influenza Vaccines,"Influenza viruses cause annual seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics of human respiratory disease. Influenza virus infections represent a serious public health and economic problem, which are most effectively prevented through vaccination.

Strategies for the treatment of femoral fractures in severely injured patients: trends in over two decades from the TraumaRegister DGU(®),"PURPOSE: Treatment strategies for femoral fracture stabilisation are well known to have a significant impact on the patient’s outcome. Therefore, the optimal choices for both the type of initial fracture stabilisation (external fixation/EF, early total care/ETC, conservative treatment/TC) and the best time point for conversion from temporary to definitive fixation are challenging factors. PATIENTS: Patients aged ≥ 16 years with moderate and severe trauma documented in the TraumaRegister DGU(®) between 2002 and 2018 were retrospectively analysed. Demographics, ISS, surgical treatment strategy (ETC vs. EF vs. TC), time for conversion to definitive care, complication (MOF, sepsis) and survival rates were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 13,091 trauma patients were included. EF patients more often sustained high-energy trauma (car: 43.1 vs. 29.5%, p < 0.001), were younger (40.6 vs. 48.1 years, p < 0.001), were more severely injured (ISS 25.4 vs. 19.1 pts., p < 0.001), and had higher sepsis (11.8 vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) and MOF rates (33.1 vs. 16.0%, p < 0.001) compared to ETC patients. A shift from ETC to EF was observed. The time until conversion decreased for femoral fractures from 9 to 8 days within the observation period. Sepsis incidences decreased in EF (20.3 to 12.3%, p < 0.001) and ETC (9.1–4.8%, p < 0.001) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the changes in the surgical treatment of severely injured patients with femur fractures over a period of almost two decades caused by the introduction of modern surgical strategies (e.g., Safe Definitive Surgery). It remains unclear which subgroups of trauma patients benefit most from these strategies.",0,"Strategies for the treatment of femoral fractures in severely injured patients: trends in over two decades from the TraumaRegister DGU(®) PURPOSE: Treatment strategies for femoral fracture stabilisation are well known to have a significant impact on the patient’s outcome.

Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis,INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to demonstrate Interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. IL-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real-time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of two months' treatment course. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. RESULTS: Of all 16 studied patients significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and P = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept which views psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.,0,Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to demonstrate Interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions.

Convergence of a common solution for broad ebolavirus neutralization by glycan cap-directed human antibodies,"Antibodies that target the glycan cap epitope on the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) are common in the adaptive response of survivors. A subset is known to be broadly neutralizing, but the details of their epitopes and basis for neutralization are not well understood. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of diverse glycan cap antibodies that variably synergize with GP base-binding antibodies. These structures describe a conserved site of vulnerability that anchors the mucin-like domains (MLDs) to the glycan cap, which we call the MLD anchor and cradle. Antibodies that bind to the MLD cradle share common features, including use of IGHV1–69 and IGHJ6 germline genes, which exploit hydrophobic residues and form β-hairpin structures to mimic the MLD anchor, disrupt MLD attachment, destabilize GP quaternary structure, and block cleavage events required for receptor binding.

(2012) Invasive bacterial infections following influenza: a time‐series analysis in Montréal, Canada, 1996–2008. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 268–275. Background Shared seasonal patterns, such as between influenza and some respiratory bacterial infections, can create associations between phenomena not causally related. Objectives To estimate the association of influenza with subsequent bacterial infections after full adjustment for confounding by seasonal and long‐term trends. Methods Time series of weekly counts of notified cases of invasive infections with Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, in Montréal, Canada, 1996–2008, were modelled by negative binomial regression, with terms representing seasonal and long‐term trends and terms for numbers of positive laboratory tests for influenza A and B. Results The associations of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis with influenza disappeared after seasonal terms were added to the model. However, the influenza B count remained associated with the S. pyogenes counts for the same week and the following week: S. pyogenes incidence rate ratios were 1.0376 (95% CI: 1.0009–1.0757) and 1.0354 (0.9958–1.0766), respectively, for each increase of 1 in the influenza count. Conclusions Influenza B accounts for about 8percnt; of the incidence of invasive S. pyogenes infections, over and above any effect associated with modellable seasonal and long‐term trends. This association of influenza B with S. pyogenes infections can be attributed largely to the years 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2008, when late peaks in influenza B counts were followed by peaks in S. pyogenes notifications.

"Identification of Modulated MicroRNAs Associated with Breast Cancer, Diet, and Physical Activity","SIMPLE SUMMARY: Healthy diet and physical activity are able to induce beneficial molecular modifications that have been associated with a lower risk of breast cancer (BC) incidence and a better prognosis for BC patients. Although the beneficial effects of healthy lifestyle have been described, the beneficial epigenetic modifications induced by dietary and exercise intervention in BC patients have not been elucidated yet. On these bases, the aim of the present study was to computationally identify microRNAs (miRNAs) strictly associated with BC progression and with dietary and exercise interventions. Through several computational approaches, a set of miRNAs modulated by diet and exercise and useful as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for BC was identified. The results obtained represent the starting point for further validation analyses performed on BC patients undergoing lifestyle interventions to propose the miRNAs here identified as novel biomarkers for BC management. ABSTRACT: Background: Several studies have shown that healthy lifestyles prevent the risk of breast cancer (BC) and are associated with better prognosis. It was hypothesized that lifestyle strategies induce microRNA (miRNA) modulation that, in turn, may lead to important epigenetic modifications. The identification of miRNAs associated with BC, diet, and physical activity may give further insights into the role played by lifestyle interventions and their efficacy for BC patients. To predict which miRNAs may be modulated by diet and physical activity in BC patients, the analyses of different miRNA expression datasets were performed. Methods: The GEO DataSets database was used to select miRNA expression datasets related to BC patients, dietary interventions, and physical exercise. Further bioinformatic approaches were used to establish the value of selected miRNAs in BC development and prognosis. Results: The analysis of datasets allowed the selection of modulated miRNAs associated with BC development, diet, and physical exercise. Seven miRNAs were also associated with the overall survival of BC patients. Conclusions: The identified miRNAs may play a role in the development of BC and may have a prognostic value in patients treated with integrative interventions including diet and physical activity.

Born to Eat Wild: An Integrated Conservation Approach to Secure Wild Food Plants for Food Security and Nutrition,"Overlooked in national reports and in conservation programs, wild food plants (WFPs) have been a vital component of food and nutrition security for centuries. Recently, several countries have reported on the widespread and regular consumption of WFPs, particularly by rural and indigenous communities but also in urban contexts. They are reported as critical for livelihood resilience and for providing essential micronutrients to people enduring food shortages or other emergency situations. However, threats derived from changes in land use and climate, overexploitation and urbanization are reducing the availability of these biological resources in the wild and contributing to the loss of traditional knowledge associated with their use. Meanwhile, few policy measures are in place explicitly targeting their conservation and sustainable use. This can be partially attributed to a lack of scientific evidence and awareness among policymakers and relevant stakeholders of the untapped potential of WFPs, accompanied by market and non-market barriers limiting their use. This paper reviews recent efforts being undertaken in several countries to build evidence of the importance of WFPs, while providing examples of cross-sectoral cooperation and multi-stakeholder approaches that are contributing to advance their conservation and sustainable use. An integrated conservation approach is proposed contributing to secure their availability for future generations.",0,"Born to Eat Wild: An Integrated Conservation Approach to Secure Wild Food Plants for Food Security and Nutrition Overlooked in national reports and in conservation programs, wild food plants (WFPs) have been a vital component of food and nutrition security for centuries.

Using experimental gaming simulations to elicit risk mitigation behavioral strategies for agricultural disease management,"Failing to mitigate propagation of disease spread can result in dire economic consequences for agricultural networks. Pathogens like Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus, can quickly spread among producers. Biosecurity is designed to prevent infection transmission. When considering biosecurity investments, management must balance the cost of protection versus the consequences of contracting an infection. Thus, an examination of the decision making processes associated with investment in biosecurity is important for enhancing system wide biosecurity. Data gathered from experimental gaming simulations can provide insights into behavioral strategies and inform the development of decision support systems. We created an online digital experiment to simulate outbreak scenarios among swine production supply chains, where participants were tasked with making biosecurity investment decisions. In Experiment One, we quantified the risk associated with each participant’s decisions and delineated three dominant categories of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk tolerant, and opportunistic. Each risk class exhibited unique approaches in reaction to risk and disease information. We also tested how information uncertainty affects risk aversion, by varying the amount of visibility of the infection as well as the amount of biosecurity implemented across the system. We found evidence that more visibility in the number of infected sites increases risk averse behaviors, while more visibility in the amount of neighboring biosecurity increased risk taking behaviors. In Experiment Two, we were surprised to find no evidence for differences in behavior of livestock specialists compared to Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Our findings provide support for using experimental gaming simulations to study how risk communication affects behavior, which can provide insights towards more effective messaging strategies.",0,"Using experimental gaming simulations to elicit risk mitigation behavioral strategies for agricultural disease management Failing to mitigate propagation of disease spread can result in dire economic consequences for agricultural networks.

Avian Influenza Virus Glycoproteins Restrict Virus Replication and Spread through Human Airway Epithelium at Temperatures of the Proximal Airways,"Transmission of avian influenza viruses from bird to human is a rare event even though avian influenza viruses infect the ciliated epithelium of human airways in vitro and ex vivo. Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.",0,"Avian Influenza Virus Glycoproteins Restrict Virus Replication and Spread through Human Airway Epithelium at Temperatures of the Proximal Airways Transmission of avian influenza viruses from bird to human is a rare event even though avian influenza viruses infect the ciliated epithelium of human airways in vitro and ex vivo.

"Culturally Competent Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation Information Practices and Electronic Health Records: Rapid Review","BACKGROUND: Outdated gender, sex, and sexual orientation (GSSO) information practices in health care contribute to health inequities for sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). Governments, statistics agencies, and health care organizations are developing and implementing modernized practices that support health equity for SGMs. Extending our work, we conducted a rapid review of grey literature to explore information practices that support quality health care for SGMs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this rapid review of grey literature was to elucidate modern GSSO information practices from leading agencies for adaptation, adoption, and application by health care providers and organizations seeking to modernize outdated GSSO information practices that contribute to health inequities among SGMs. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Google from 2015 to 2020 with terms related to gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records for English-language grey literature resources including government and nongovernment organization publications, whitepapers, data standards, toolkits, health care organization and health quality practice and policy guides, conference proceedings, unpublished academic work, and statistical papers. Peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded, as were resources irrelevant to information practices. We also screened the reference sections of included articles for additional resources, and canvassed a working group of international topic experts for additional relevant resources. Duplicates were eliminated. ATLAS.ti was used to support analysis. Themes and codes were developed through an iterative process of writing and discussion with the research team. RESULTS: Twenty-six grey literature resources met the inclusion criteria. The overarching themes that emerged from the literature were the interrelated behaviors, attitudes, and policies that constitute SGM cultural competence as follows: shared language with unambiguous definitions of GSSO concepts; welcoming and inclusive care environments and affirming practices to reduce barriers to access; health care policy that supports competent health care; and adoption of modernized GSSO information practices and electronic health record design requirements that address invisibility in health data. CONCLUSIONS: Health equity for SGMs requires systemic change. Binary representation of sex and gender in electronic health records (EHRs) obfuscates natural and cultural diversity and, in the context of health care, places SGM patients at risk of clinical harm because it leads to clinical assumptions. Agencies and agents in health care need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate modern attitudes, policies, and practices that enable health equity for SGMs. Adopting small but important changes in the language and terminology used in technical and social health care systems is essential for institutionalizing SGM competency.

A hybrid modeling approach for assessing mechanistic models of small molecule partitioning in vivo using a machine learning-integrated modeling platform,"Prediction of the first-in-human dosing regimens is a critical step in drug development and requires accurate quantitation of drug distribution. Traditional in vivo studies used to characterize clinical candidate’s volume of distribution are error-prone, time- and cost-intensive and lack reproducibility in clinical settings. The paper demonstrates how a computational platform integrating machine learning optimization with mechanistic modeling can be used to simulate compound plasma concentration profile and predict tissue-plasma partition coefficients with high accuracy by varying the lipophilicity descriptor logP. The approach applied to chemically diverse small molecules resulted in comparable geometric mean fold-errors of 1.50 and 1.63 in pharmacokinetic outputs for direct tissue:plasma partition and hybrid logP optimization, with the latter enabling prediction of tissue permeation that can be used to guide toxicity and efficacy dosing in human subjects. The optimization simulations required to achieve these results were parallelized on the AWS cloud and generated outputs in under 5 h. Accuracy, speed, and scalability of the framework indicate that it can be used to assess the relevance of other mechanistic relationships implicated in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic phenomena with a lower risk of overfitting datasets and generate large database of physiologically-relevant drug disposition for further integration with machine learning models.",0,"A hybrid modeling approach for assessing mechanistic models of small molecule partitioning in vivo using a machine learning-integrated modeling platform Prediction of the first-in-human dosing regimens is a critical step in drug development and requires accurate quantitation of drug distribution.

Exaggerated Autophagy in Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection: A Transcriptome Pilot Analysis of Human Ascending Aortic Tissues,"Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is one of the most dangerous diseases of acute aortic syndrome. Molecular pathological studies on TAAD can aid in understanding the disease comprehensively and can provide insights into new diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we defined the molecular pathology of TAAD by performing transcriptome sequencing of human ascending aortic tissues. Pathway analysis revealed that activated inflammation, cell death and smooth muscle cell degeneration are the main pathological changes in aortic dissection. However, autophagy is considered to be one of the most important biological processes, regulating inflammatory reactions and degenerative changes. Therefore, we focused on the pathological role of autophagy in aortic dissection and identified 10 autophagy-regulated hub genes, which are all upregulated in TAAD. These results indicate that exaggerated autophagy participates in the pathological process of aortic dissection and may provide new insight for further basic research on TAAD.",0,"Exaggerated Autophagy in Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection: A Transcriptome Pilot Analysis of Human Ascending Aortic Tissues Stanford type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is one of the most dangerous diseases of acute aortic syndrome.

Evaluating Behavioral and Linguistic Changes During Drug Treatment for Depression Using Tweets in Spanish: Pairwise Comparison Study,"BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are the most common mental illnesses, and they constitute the leading cause of disability worldwide. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of depressive disorders. Some people share information about their experiences with antidepressants on social media platforms such as Twitter. Analysis of the messages posted by Twitter users under SSRI treatment can yield useful information on how these antidepressants affect users’ behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the behavioral and linguistic characteristics of the tweets posted while users were likely to be under SSRI treatment, in comparison to the tweets posted by the same users when they were less likely to be taking this medication. METHODS: In the first step, the timelines of Twitter users mentioning SSRI antidepressants in their tweets were selected using a list of 128 generic and brand names of SSRIs. In the second step, two datasets of tweets were created, the in-treatment dataset (made up of the tweets posted throughout the 30 days after mentioning an SSRI) and the unknown-treatment dataset (made up of tweets posted more than 90 days before or more than 90 days after any tweet mentioning an SSRI). For each user, the changes in behavioral and linguistic features between the tweets classified in these two datasets were analyzed. 186 users and their timelines with 668,842 tweets were finally included in the study. RESULTS: The number of tweets generated per day by the users when they were in treatment was higher than it was when they were in the unknown-treatment period (P=.001). When the users were in treatment, the mean percentage of tweets posted during the daytime (from 8 AM to midnight) increased in comparison to the unknown-treatment period (P=.002). The number of characters and words per tweet was higher when the users were in treatment (P=.03 and P=.02, respectively). Regarding linguistic features, the percentage of pronouns that were first-person singular was higher when users were in treatment (P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and linguistic changes have been detected when users with depression are taking antidepressant medication. These features can provide interesting insights for monitoring the evolution of this disease, as well as offering additional information related to treatment adherence. This information may be especially useful in patients who are receiving long-term treatments such as people suffering from depression.",0,"Evaluating Behavioral and Linguistic Changes During Drug Treatment for Depression Using Tweets in Spanish: Pairwise Comparison Study BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are the most common mental illnesses, and they constitute the leading cause of disability worldwide.

An audit to analyse the two-week wait pathway at an oral cancer specialist district general hospital,"Background The incidence of head and neck cancers is increasing, alongside a decrease in associated mortality. Currently, medical and dental practitioners can refer patients to be seen urgently within two weeks. The appropriateness of these referrals has been disputed. In 2020, the Department of Health aims for patients to be given cancer diagnoses within 28 days from referral. Methods A retrospective audit was conducted for all patients referred under the two-week wait pathway in a six-month period. In the first cycle of this audit, one month's worth of urgent referrals were analysed; given the small sample size, very few recommendations could be made. The audit cycle was repeated and it analysed six months' worth of data, which gave a much more representative study. All patients were analysed to see if the 14-day period had been breached. Positive cancer patients were further assessed to see if their diagnosis had been given within 28 days and treatments within 62 days. Results Of the 569 patients seen, there was a positive malignancy diagnostic yield of 7.38%. Nineteen patients breached the 14-day wait. Of the positive patients, 45.2% received their diagnosis more than 28 days from referral, and 22.2% of these patients received treatment after 62 days. Conclusion The department performed well despite the high number of referrals. This audit has touched on some key issues which have been discussed in detail in this article. Furthermore, this audit recommends a concerted effort to improve oral cancer detections skills among GDPs and GMPs. While all referrals may be appropriate from a primary care point of view, this audit makes it apparent that better differentiation is needed between malignant and routinely manageable lesions. All secondary care units alongside general practitioners can learn from the findings of this audit.",0,"An audit to analyse the two-week wait pathway at an oral cancer specialist district general hospital Background The incidence of head and neck cancers is increasing, alongside a decrease in associated mortality.

Of the positive patients, 45.2% received their diagnosis more than 28 days from referral, and 22.2% of these patients received treatment after 62 days. Conclusion The department performed well despite the high number of referrals. This audit has touched on some key issues which have been discussed in detail in this article. Furthermore, this audit recommends a concerted effort to improve oral cancer detections skills among GDPs and GMPs. While all referrals may be appropriate from a primary care point of view, this audit makes it apparent that better differentiation is needed between malignant and routinely manageable lesions. All secondary care units alongside general practitioners can learn from the findings of this audit.",an audit to analyse the twoweek wait pathway at an oral cancer specialist district general hospital background the incidence of head and neck cancers is increasing alongside a decrease in associated mortality currently medical and dental practitioners can refer patients to be seen urgently within two weeks the appropriateness of these referrals has been disputed in 2020 the department of health aims for patients to be given cancer diagnoses within 28 days from referral methods a retrospective audit was conducted for all patients referred under the twoweek wait pathway in a sixmonth period in the first cycle of this audit one months worth of urgent referrals were analysed given the small sample size very few recommendations could be made the audit cycle was repeated and it analysed six months worth of data which gave a much more representative study all patients were analysed to see if the 14day period had been breached positive cancer patients were further assessed to see if their diagnosis had been given within 28 days and treatments within 62 days results of the 569 patients seen there was a positive malignancy diagnostic yield of 738 nineteen patients breached the 14day wait of the positive patients 452 received their diagnosis more than 28 days from referral and 222 of these patients received treatment after 62 days conclusion the department performed well despite the high number of referrals this audit has touched on some key issues which have been discussed in detail in this article furthermore this audit recommends a concerted effort to improve oral cancer detections skills among gdps and gmps while all referrals may be appropriate from a primary care point of view this audit makes it apparent that better differentiation is needed between malignant and routinely manageable lesions all secondary care units alongside general practitioners can learn from the findings of this audit,1
Directed Fusion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Cardiomyocytes via VSV-G Facilitates Stem Cell Programming,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) spontaneously fuse with somatic cells in vivo, albeit rarely, and the fusion products are capable of tissue-specific function (mature trait) or proliferation (immature trait), depending on the microenvironment. That stem cells can be programmed, or somatic cells reprogrammed, in this fashion suggests that stem cell fusion holds promise as a therapeutic approach for the repair of damaged tissues, especially tissues not readily capable of functional regeneration, such as the myocardium. In an attempt to increase the frequency of stem cell fusion and, in so doing, increase the potential for cardiac tissue repair, we expressed the fusogen of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) in human MSCs. We found VSV-G expressing MSCs (vMSCs) fused with cardiomyocytes (CMs) and these fusion products adopted a CM-like phenotype and morphology in vitro. In vivo, vMSCs delivered to damaged mouse myocardium via a collagen patch were able to home to the myocardium and fuse to cells within the infarct and peri-infarct region of the myocardium. This study provides a basis for the investigation of the biological impact of fusion of stem cells with CMs in vivo and illustrates how viral fusion proteins might better enable such studies.",0,"Directed Fusion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Cardiomyocytes via VSV-G Facilitates Stem Cell Programming Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) spontaneously fuse with somatic cells in vivo, albeit rarely, and the fusion products are capable of tissue-specific function (mature trait) or proliferation (immature trait), depending on the microenvironment.

Undergraduate Virtual Engagement in Community Genome Annotation Provides Flexibility to Overcome Course Disruptions,"Recently, students and faculty have been forced to deal with unprecedented disruptions to their courses and broader uncertainties that have presented serious challenges to quality instruction. We present a flexible, team-based approach to teaching and learning that can transition seamlessly between face-to-face, hybrid, and fully online instruction when disruptions occur. We have built a community genome annotation program that can be implemented as a module in a biology course, as an entire course, or as directed research projects. This approach maintains an engaging and supportive educational environment and provides students the opportunity to learn and contribute to science with undergraduate research. Students are provided guidance through multiple interactions with faculty and peer mentors to support their progress and encourage learning. Integration of the developed instructional tools with available technology ensures that students can contribute remotely. Through this process, students seamlessly continue their annotation coursework, participate in undergraduate research, and prepare abstracts and posters for virtual conferences. Importantly, this strategy does not impose any additional burden or workload on students, who may already be overwhelmed with the additional work associated with the transition to remote learning. Here, we present tips for implementing this instructional platform, provide an overview of tools that facilitate instruction, and discuss expected educational outcomes.",0,"Undergraduate Virtual Engagement in Community Genome Annotation Provides Flexibility to Overcome Course Disruptions Recently, students and faculty have been forced to deal with unprecedented disruptions to their courses and broader uncertainties that have presented serious challenges to quality instruction.

"Subcutaneous, Paracardiac, and Epicardial Fat CT Density Before/After Contrast Injection: Any Correlation with CAD?","Adipose tissue, in particular epicardial adipose tissue, has been identified as a potential biomarker of cardiovascular pathologies such as coronary artery disease (CAD) in the light of its metabolic activity and close anatomic and pathophysiologic relationship to the heart. Our purpose was to evaluate epicardial adipose tissue density at both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), along with CT densities of paracardiac and subcutaneous adipose tissue, as well as the relations of such densities with CAD. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent cardiac CT at our institution for CAD assessment. We segmented regions of interest on epicardial, paracardiac, and subcutaneous adipose tissue on unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scans. A total of 480 patients were included, 164 of them presenting with CAD. Median epicardial adipose tissue density measured on contrast-enhanced scans (−81.5 HU; interquartile range −84.9 to −78.0) was higher than that measured on unenhanced scans (−73.4 HU; −76.9 to −69.4) (p < 0.001), whereas paracardiac and subcutaneous adipose tissue densities were not (p ≥ 0.055). Patients with or without CAD, did not show significant differences in density of epicardial, paracardiac, and subcutaneous adipose tissue either on unenhanced or contrast-enhanced scans (p ≥ 0.092). CAD patients may experience different phenomena (inflammation, fibrosis, increase in adipose depots) leading to rises or drops in epicardial adipose tissue density, resulting in variations that are difficult to detect.",0,"Subcutaneous, Paracardiac, and Epicardial Fat CT Density Before/After Contrast Injection: Any Correlation with CAD?

Inhibiting APOBEC3 Activity with Single-Stranded DNA Containing 2′-Deoxyzebularine Analogues,"[Image: see text] APOBEC3 enzymes form part of the innate immune system by deaminating cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and thereby preventing the spread of pathogenic genetic information. However, APOBEC mutagenesis is also exploited by viruses and cancer cells to increase rates of evolution, escape adaptive immune responses, and resist drugs. This raises the possibility of APOBEC3 inhibition as a strategy for augmenting existing antiviral and anticancer therapies. Here we show that, upon incorporation into short ssDNAs, the cytidine nucleoside analogue 2′-deoxyzebularine (dZ) becomes capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of selected APOBEC variants derived from APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3G, supporting a mechanism in which ssDNA delivers dZ to the active site. Multiple experimental approaches, including isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence polarization, protein thermal shift, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy assays, demonstrate nanomolar dissociation constants and low micromolar inhibition constants. These dZ-containing ssDNAs constitute the first substrate-like APOBEC3 inhibitors and, together, comprise a platform for developing nucleic acid-based inhibitors with cellular activity.",0,"Inhibiting APOBEC3 Activity with Single-Stranded DNA Containing 2′-Deoxyzebularine Analogues [Image: see text] APOBEC3 enzymes form part of the innate immune system by deaminating cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and thereby preventing the spread of pathogenic genetic information.

Progression from Type 2 Macular Neovascularization to Fibrovascular Pigment Epithelial Detachment,"The aim of this study was to report unusual progression of type 2 macular neovascularization (MNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), high myopia or angioid streaks. Retrospective multicentric observational case series data were used. Eyes that progressed from type 2 MNV secondary to AMD, high myopia or angioid streaks to fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment (PED) were included. A total of 29 treatment-naive eyes from 29 patients with type 2 MNV secondary to AMD (n = 14), high myopia (n = 10) or angioid streaks (n = 5) that progressed to a fibrovascular PED on Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography were used. This progression occurred within 3 months after anti-VEGF therapy initiation. Logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) visual acuity improved significantly after anti-VEGF therapy, from 0.55 (SD ± 0.30) (20/63–20/80) at baseline to 0.30 (20/40) at 3 months, and 0.33 (20/40) at the final follow-up (mean follow up: 3.68 years). Mean number of intravitreal injections per year for patients with a total follow-up ≥ 12 months (n = 24) was 4.3 ± 2.1 per year. Progression from type 2 MNV to a fibrovascular PED may occur in patients suffering from AMD, high myopia or angioid streaks. This progression appears early after initiation of anti-VEGF therapy and is associated with a favorable visual and anatomical outcome, at least on a short follow up basis.",0,"Progression from Type 2 Macular Neovascularization to Fibrovascular Pigment Epithelial Detachment The aim of this study was to report unusual progression of type 2 macular neovascularization (MNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), high myopia or angioid streaks.

Advantages and Limitations of Anticipating Laboratory Test Results from Regression- and Tree-Based Rules Derived from Electronic Health-Record Data,"Laboratory testing is the single highest-volume medical activity, making it useful to ask how well one can anticipate whether a given test result will be high, low, or within the reference interval (“normal”). We analyzed 10 years of electronic health records—a total of 69.4 million blood tests—to see how well standard rule-mining techniques can anticipate test results based on patient age and gender, recent diagnoses, and recent laboratory test results. We evaluated rules according to their positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC AUCs). Using a stringent cutoff of PPV and/or NPV≥0.95, standard techniques yield few rules for sendout tests but several for in-house tests, mostly for repeat laboratory tests that are part of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. Most rules were clinically and pathophysiologically plausible, and several seemed clinically useful for informing pre-test probability of a given result. But overall, rules were unlikely to be able to function as a general substitute for actually ordering a test. Improving laboratory utilization will likely require different input data and/or alternative methods.",0,"Advantages and Limitations of Anticipating Laboratory Test Results from Regression- and Tree-Based Rules Derived from Electronic Health-Record Data Laboratory testing is the single highest-volume medical activity, making it useful to ask how well one can anticipate whether a given test result will be high, low, or within the reference interval (“normal”).

Deep generative selection models of T and B cell receptor repertoires with soNNia,"Subclasses of lymphocytes carry different functional roles to work together and produce an immune response and lasting immunity. Additionally to these functional roles, T and B cell lymphocytes rely on the diversity of their receptor chains to recognize different pathogens. The lymphocyte subclasses emerge from common ancestors generated with the same diversity of receptors during selection processes. Here, we leverage biophysical models of receptor generation with machine learning models of selection to identify specific sequence features characteristic of functional lymphocyte repertoires and subrepertoires. Specifically, using only repertoire-level sequence information, we classify CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, find correlations between receptor chains arising during selection, and identify T cell subsets that are targets of pathogenic epitopes. We also show examples of when simple linear classifiers do as well as more complex machine learning methods.",0,"Deep generative selection models of T and B cell receptor repertoires with soNNia Subclasses of lymphocytes carry different functional roles to work together and produce an immune response and lasting immunity.

Tracking prototype and exemplar representations in the brain across learning,"There is a long-standing debate about whether categories are represented by individual category members (exemplars) or by the central tendency abstracted from individual members (prototypes). Neuroimaging studies have shown neural evidence for either exemplar representations or prototype representations, but not both. Presently, we asked whether it is possible for multiple types of category representations to exist within a single task. We designed a categorization task to promote both exemplar and prototype representations and tracked their formation across learning. We found only prototype correlates during the final test. However, interim tests interspersed throughout learning showed prototype and exemplar representations across distinct brain regions that aligned with previous studies: prototypes in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior hippocampus and exemplars in inferior frontal gyrus and lateral parietal cortex. These findings indicate that, under the right circumstances, individuals may form representations at multiple levels of specificity, potentially facilitating a broad range of future decisions.",0,"Tracking prototype and exemplar representations in the brain across learning There is a long-standing debate about whether categories are represented by individual category members (exemplars) or by the central tendency abstracted from individual members (prototypes).

Using Ambient Assisted Living to Monitor Older Adults With Alzheimer Disease: Single-Case Study to Validate the Monitoring Report,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults choose to live independently in their homes for as long as possible, despite psychosocial and medical conditions that compromise their independence in daily living and safety. Faced with unprecedented challenges in allocating resources, home care administrators are increasingly open to using monitoring technologies known as ambient assisted living (AAL) to better support care recipients. To be effective, these technologies should be able to report clinically relevant changes to support decision making at an individual level. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the concurrent validity of AAL monitoring reports and information gathered by care professionals using triangulation. METHODS: This longitudinal single-case study spans over 490 days of monitoring a 90-year-old woman with Alzheimer disease receiving support from local health care services. A clinical nurse in charge of her health and social care was interviewed 3 times during the project. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to analyze each daily activity (ie, sleep, outing activities, periods of low mobility, cooking-related activities, hygiene-related activities). Significant changes observed in data from monitoring reports were compared with information gathered by the care professional to explore concurrent validity. RESULTS: Over time, the monitoring reports showed evolving trends in the care recipient’s daily activities. Significant activity changes occurred over time regarding sleep, outings, cooking, mobility, and hygiene-related activities. Although the nurse observed some trends, the monitoring reports highlighted information that the nurse had not yet identified. Most trends detected in the monitoring reports were consistent with the clinical information gathered by the nurse. In addition, the AAL system detected changes in daily trends following an intervention specific to meal preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, trends identified by AAL monitoring are consistent with clinical reports. They help answer the nurse’s questions and help the nurse develop interventions to maintain the care recipient at home. These findings suggest the vast potential of AAL technologies to support health care services and aging in place by providing valid and clinically relevant information over time regarding activities of daily living. Such data are essential when other sources yield incomplete information for decision making.",0,"Using Ambient Assisted Living to Monitor Older Adults With Alzheimer Disease: Single-Case Study to Validate the Monitoring Report BACKGROUND: Many older adults choose to live independently in their homes for as long as possible, despite psychosocial and medical conditions that compromise their independence in daily living and safety.

Expression and distribution of the receptors for coxsackievirus B3 during fetal development of the Balb/c mouse and of their brain cells in culture,"This study was designed mainly to determine the relationships between the expression and distribution of the cellular receptor proteins for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and susceptibility of mouse brain cells during fetal development of Balb/c mice. Immunoblot analysis of fetal extracts demonstrated that the CVB3 receptor proteins were first expressed at day 14 of the fetal stage, and that maximal expression of the cellular receptor occurred at near term or newborn stage. Results also suggested that newborn mouse brain tissue expressed much larger quantities of viral receptor proteins, compared to other tissues. In vitro studies showed that both mouse neurons and astrocytes could be infected by two CVB3 strains, pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain (CVB3N) and myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain (CVB3W). CVB3N, however, replicated and grew to high titer in primary astrocyte cultures and in primary neuron cultures, whereas, primary astrocyte cultures were relatively resistant to CVB3W. Virus binding assays revealed that CVB3N bound faster and in greater amounts to mouse brain cells than CVBW. These two virus strains, however, were found to share the same receptor specificity by virus competition assays. The number of virus binding sites for CVB3 on newborn mouse brain cells was approximately 1.8 × 10(4) per cell. The data suggested that preferential expression of the cellular receptors on newborn mouse brain cells may be related to their high susceptibilities to CVB3 infection.",0,"Expression and distribution of the receptors for coxsackievirus B3 during fetal development of the Balb/c mouse and of their brain cells in culture This study was designed mainly to determine the relationships between the expression and distribution of the cellular receptor proteins for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and susceptibility of mouse brain cells during fetal development of Balb/c mice.

Global Regulatory Landscape for Aggregate Safety Assessments: Recent Developments and Future Directions,"Notwithstanding successful harmonization efforts, the global regulatory framework governing product safety is complex and continually evolving, as evidenced by additional regional guidance and regulations. In this regulatory review, we provide an overview from both global and regional perspectives. A historical perspective, with a focus on recent developments, enables identification of important long–term trends, such as a shift from single–case medical review of serious adverse events to an interdisciplinary evaluation of aggregate data for the purpose of judging product causality and informing benefit–risk assessments. We will show how these trends lead to opportunities for closer interdisciplinary collaboration, for bridging the gap between preand postmarketing surveillance, and for a more proactive determination of patient populations with a positive benefit–risk profile for product use.

The role of the combination of IL‐2 and TGF‐β or IL‐10 in the generation and function of CD4(+) CD25(+) and CD8(+)regulatory T cell subsets,"Recently, considerable attention has been focused on thymus‐derived CD4(+) regulatory T cells that constitutively express CD25 and have a contact‐dependent, cytokine‐independent mechanism in vitro. However, peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells can also be induced to become regulatory T cells. Here we review our studies using the combination of IL‐2 and transforming growth factor β (TGF‐β) to generate regulatory T cell subsets ex vivo, and the work of others using IL‐10 to induce suppressive activity. Under certain conditions, the autocrine effects of TGF‐β and IL‐10 induce peripheral T cells to produce immunosuppressive levels of each of these cytokines. This effect of TGF‐β is IL‐2 dependent. Under other conditions IL‐2 and TGF‐β can induce CD4(+) cells to develop potent contact‐dependent, cytokine‐independent regulatory activity. At present, there is considerable confusion concerning the mechanism of action of CD4(+) CD25(+) cells because cytokine‐producing regulatory T cells generated in the periphery can express CD25 and other markers displayed by naturally occurring, thymus‐derived regulatory T cells. We, therefore, propose a nomenclature that identifies thymus‐derived and peripheral regulatory cells, and that also differentiates T regulatory cells from T helper cells. Because T regulatory cells broadly control T helper cell reactivity, the mechanisms that control regulatory cell function are also reviewed. Finally, the potential use of regulatory T cells generated ex vivo as an adoptive immunotherapy for certain autoimmune diseases, to prevent organ graft rejection, or to prevent pathologic host responses to infectious agents is discussed.",0,"The role of the combination of IL‐2 and TGF‐β or IL‐10 in the generation and function of CD4(+) CD25(+) and CD8(+)regulatory T cell subsets Recently, considerable attention has been focused on thymus‐derived CD4(+) regulatory T cells that constitutively express CD25 and have a contact‐dependent, cytokine‐independent mechanism in vitro.

Generation of inner ear hair cells by direct lineage conversion of primary somatic cells,"The mechanoreceptive sensory hair cells in the inner ear are selectively vulnerable to numerous genetic and environmental insults. In mammals, hair cells lack regenerative capacity, and their death leads to permanent hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Their paucity and inaccessibility has limited the search for otoprotective and regenerative strategies. Growing hair cells in vitro would provide a route to overcome this experimental bottleneck. We report a combination of four transcription factors (Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3, and Gfi1) that can convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail-tip fibroblasts and postnatal supporting cells into induced hair cell-like cells (iHCs). iHCs exhibit hair cell-like morphology, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles, electrophysiological properties, mechanosensory channel expression, and vulnerability to ototoxin in a high-content phenotypic screening system. Thus, direct reprogramming provides a platform to identify causes and treatments for hair cell loss, and may help identify future gene therapy approaches for restoring hearing.",0,"Generation of inner ear hair cells by direct lineage conversion of primary somatic cells The mechanoreceptive sensory hair cells in the inner ear are selectively vulnerable to numerous genetic and environmental insults.

Outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and brought to a referral center,"PURPOSE: Patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are candidates for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. The evaluation of organ severity is difficult in patients considered for cannulation in a distant hospital. This study was designed to identify early factors associated with hospital mortality in ARDS patients treated with ECMO and retrieved from referring hospitals. METHODS: Data from 85 consecutive ARDS patients equipped with ECMO by our mobile team and consequently admitted to our ICU were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The main ARDS etiologies were community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (35 %), influenza pneumonia (23 %) (with 12 patients having been treated during the first half of the study period), and nosocomial pneumonia (14 %). The median (interquartile range) time between contact from the referring hospital and patient cannulation was 3 (1–4) h. ECMO was venovenous in 77 (91 %) patients. No complications occurred during transport by our mobile unit. Forty-eight patients died at the hospital (56 %). Based on a multivariate logistic regression, a score including age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia was constructed. The probability of hospital mortality following ECMO initiation was 40 % in the 0–2 score class (n = 58) and 93 % in the 3–4 score class (n = 27). Patients with an influenza pneumonia diagnosis and a SOFA score before ECMO of less than 12 had a mortality rate of 22 %.

Convolutional Neural Networks Using Enhanced Radiographs for Real-Time Detection of Sitophilus zeamais in Maize Grain,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) such as deep learning in the quality control of grains has the potential to assist analysts in decision making and improving procedures. Advanced technologies based on X-ray imaging provide markedly easier ways to control insect infestation of stored products, regardless of whether the quality features are visible on the surface of the grains. Here, we applied contrast enhancement algorithms based on peripheral equalization and calcification emphasis on X-ray images to improve the detection of Sitophilus zeamais in maize grains. In addition, we proposed an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identity non-infested and infested classes using three different architectures; (i) Inception-ResNet-v2, (ii) Xception and (iii) MobileNetV2. In general, the prediction models developed based on the MobileNetV2 and Xception architectures achieved higher accuracy (≥0.88) in identifying non-infested grains and grains infested by maize weevil, with a correct classification from 0.78 to 1.00 for validation and test sets. Hence, the proposed approach using enhanced radiographs has the potential to provide precise control of Sitophilus zeamais for safe human consumption of maize grains. The proposed method can automatically recognize food contaminated with hidden storage pests without manual features, which makes it more reliable for grain inspection.",0,"Convolutional Neural Networks Using Enhanced Radiographs for Real-Time Detection of Sitophilus zeamais in Maize Grain The application of artificial intelligence (AI) such as deep learning in the quality control of grains has the potential to assist analysts in decision making and improving procedures.

In general, the prediction models developed based on the MobileNetV2 and Xception architectures achieved higher accuracy (≥0.88) in identifying non-infested grains and grains infested by maize weevil, with a correct classification from 0.78 to 1.00 for validation and test sets. Hence, the proposed approach using enhanced radiographs has the potential to provide precise control of Sitophilus zeamais for safe human consumption of maize grains. The proposed method can automatically recognize food contaminated with hidden storage pests without manual features, which makes it more reliable for grain inspection.",convolutional neural networks using enhanced radiographs for realtime detection of sitophilus zeamais in maize grain the application of artificial intelligence ai such as deep learning in the quality control of grains has the potential to assist analysts in decision making and improving procedures advanced technologies based on xray imaging provide markedly easier ways to control insect infestation of stored products regardless of whether the quality features are visible on the surface of the grains here we applied contrast enhancement algorithms based on peripheral equalization and calcification emphasis on xray images to improve the detection of sitophilus zeamais in maize grains in addition we proposed an approach based on convolutional neural networks cnns to identity noninfested and infested classes using three different architectures i inceptionresnetv2 ii xception and iii mobilenetv2 in general the prediction models developed based on the mobilenetv2 and xception architectures achieved higher accuracy 088 in identifying noninfested grains and grains infested by maize weevil with a correct classification from 078 to 100 for validation and test sets hence the proposed approach using enhanced radiographs has the potential to provide precise control of sitophilus zeamais for safe human consumption of maize grains the proposed method can automatically recognize food contaminated with hidden storage pests without manual features which makes it more reliable for grain inspection,1
"Pneumonia in Bhutanese children: what we know, and what we need to know","BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in under-five children worldwide. We conducted a systematic review to identify the knowledge gaps around childhood pneumonia in Bhutan. METHODS: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google scholar from conception to 3rd December 2018, World Health Organization, UNICEF, Bhutan’s Ministry of Health and other local databases for relevant reports. We included any report describing pneumonia in Bhutanese children with regards to the burden of the disease, aetiology, related risk factors, clinical and prognostic characteristics, surveillance systems and national preventive strategies. Two review authors identified the records. We summarized the findings narratively. RESULTS: We included 44 records. Although with notable decreasing trends, pneumonia is still accountable for a high burden and mortality rate in Bhutanese children. The national surveillance system focuses mainly on influenza identification but has recently introduced other viral aetiology to monitor. We found very scarce or no data with regard to the bacterial aetiology, related risk factors and clinico-radiological and prognostic characteristics. CONCLUSION: There is a dearth of data regarding the epidemiological, microbiological, clinical and radiological characteristics of pneumonia in children in Bhutan, leading to challenges while implementing evidence-based management and effective national preventive strategies.",0,"Pneumonia in Bhutanese children: what we know, and what we need to know BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in under-five children worldwide.

The intrinsically disordered C‐terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein interacts with the C‐terminal domain of the phosphoprotein via two distinct sites and remains predominantly unfolded,"Measles virus is a negative‐sense, single‐stranded RNA virus within theMononegavirales order,which includes several human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses. Themeasles virus nucleoprotein consists of a structured N‐terminal domain, and of an intrinsically disordered C‐terminal domain, N(TAIL) (aa 401–525), which undergoes induced folding in the presence of the C‐terminal domain (XD, aa 459–507) of the viral phosphoprotein. With in N(TAIL), an α‐helical molecular recognition element (α‐MoRE, aa 488–499) involved in binding to P and in induced folding was identified and then observed in the crystal structure of XD. Using small‐angle X‐ray scattering, we have derived a low‐resolution structural model of the complex between XD and N(TAIL), which shows that most of N(TAIL) remains disordered in the complex despite P‐induced folding within the α‐MoRE. The model consists of an extended shape accommodating the multiple conformations adopted by the disordered N‐terminal region of N(TAIL), and of a bulky globular region, corresponding to XD and to the C terminus of N(TAIL) (aa 486–525). Using surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and heteronuclear magnetic resonance, we show that N(TAIL) has an additional site (aa 517–525) involved in binding to XD but not in the unstructured‐to‐structured transition. This work provides evidence that intrinsically disordered domains can establish complex interactions with their partners, and can contact them through multiple sites that do not all necessarily gain regular secondary structure.",0,"The intrinsically disordered C‐terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein interacts with the C‐terminal domain of the phosphoprotein via two distinct sites and remains predominantly unfolded Measles virus is a negative‐sense, single‐stranded RNA virus within theMononegavirales order,which includes several human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses.

Refining rare weed trait syndromes along arable intensification gradients,"QUESTION: How does the conservation (rarity) value of arable weed communities differ along intensification gradients? Which functional traits best distinguish the weed communities of more and less extensively managed fields? Can the same traits predict the rarity of individual weed species? LOCATION: Hungary. METHODS: Using relevé data from 60 cereal and 70 stubble fields, together with weed trait data, we characterized community responses to arable intensification using functional trait analyses based on trait‐convergence and trait‐divergence assembly patterns. We also examined how well the broad‐scale rarity status of species predicts their occurrence along intensification gradients, and how it maps onto our functional classifications describing intensification responses. RESULTS: The response of weeds to intensification in cereal fields was best described by a functional classification based on species' flowering duration, maximum height and seed weight: weeds of extensively managed fields have short flowering seasons (2–5 mo) and particularly large or small seeds. The highest proportions of rare species also happen to be found in these groups. The rarest weeds among these species tend to be late‐winter and early‐summer annuals, while the rare species of stubble fields tend to be broad‐leaved with low nitrogen requirements, small seeds and short height. Stubble fields showed a decline in weed cover with increasing application of fertilizer and distance from the field edge, but we could detect no strong associations of management factors with trait composition, perhaps because the intensification gradient across these fields was shorter. CONCLUSIONS: Many rare Hungarian weeds are associated with traditional extensive farming practices. They are particularly characterized by short, midsummer flowering periods and by preference for low nitrogen levels, but a range of trait syndromes must be considered to understand their ecology and conservation. Analyses based on trait‐divergence patterns, rather than trait‐convergence patterns, provide better insights into the functional composition of weed communities, emphasizing the importance of disruptive filters in weed community assembly and the need for improved methods to detect such effects.",0,"Refining rare weed trait syndromes along arable intensification gradients QUESTION: How does the conservation (rarity) value of arable weed communities differ along intensification gradients?

The impact of indole-3-lactic acid on immature intestinal innate immunity and development: a transcriptomic analysis,"An excessive intestinal inflammatory response may have a role in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm infants. Indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) of breastmilk tryptophan was identified as the anti-inflammatory metabolite involved in probiotic conditioned media from Bifidobacteria longum subsp infantis. This study aimed to explore the molecular endocytic pathways involved in the protective ILA effect against inflammation. H4 cells, Caco-2 cells, C57BL/6 pup and adult mice were used to compare the anti-inflammatory mechanisms between immature and mature enterocytes in vitro and in vivo. The results show that ILA has pleiotropic protective effects on immature enterocytes including anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and developmental regulatory potentials in a region-dependent and an age-dependent manner. Quantitative transcriptomic analysis revealed a new mechanistic model in which STAT1 pathways play an important role in IL-1β-induced inflammation and ILA has a regulatory effect on STAT1 pathways. These studies were validated by real-time RT-qPCR and STAT1 inhibitor experiments. Different protective reactions of ILA between immature and mature enterocytes indicated that ILA’s effects are developmentally regulated. These findings may be helpful in preventing NEC for premature infants.",0,"The impact of indole-3-lactic acid on immature intestinal innate immunity and development: a transcriptomic analysis An excessive intestinal inflammatory response may have a role in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm infants.

Medicinal Plant Active Compounds Produced by UV-B Exposure,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a part of the sunlight reaching Earth surface. The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310–400 nm, UV-B: 280–310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O(3). In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27–31, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013–2019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed. Here we review the effect of UV-B exposure on metabolites, volatiles, and antioxidants potential in medicinal plants.

Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks,"In this study, we present representative human contact networks among Chinese college students. Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period. Our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control.",0,"Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks In this study, we present representative human contact networks among Chinese college students.

"Characterization of HIV-1 subtypes and drug resistance mutations in Henan Province, China (2017–2019)","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection remains a severe public health problem worldwide. In this study, we investigated the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among patients with HIV-1 infection in Henan Province, China. HIV-1 strains in blood samples taken from inpatients and outpatients visiting the Sixth People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou from August 2017 to July 2019 with a viral load (VL) greater than 1000 copies/ml were subjected to subtype and DRMs analysis. Out of a total of 769 samples, subtype and DRM data were obtained from 657 (85.43%) samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial pol gene sequences indicated that the most commonly found genotype was subtype B (45.51%, 299/657), followed by CRF01_AE (28.61%, 188/657), CRF07_BC (15.68%, 103/657), CRF08_BC (0.76%, 5/657), C (0.61%, 4/657), A (0.30%, 2/657), and others (8.52%, 56/657). Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were most commonly found in patients who were naïve to antiretroviral treatment (ART) (68.67%, 160/233). The percentage of patients with one or more major drug-resistance mutations was 50.99% (335/657), and it was 6.44% (15/233) in ART-naive patients that were primarily infected with subtype B (17.74%). Resistance mutations were most common at codons 65, 103, 106, 184, and 190 of the reverse transcriptase gene and codon 46 of the protease gene. Our study provides detailed information about the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the incidence of drug resistance mutations of different subtypes in ART-experienced and naïve patients.

The Smart Class Teaching Module for Rehabilitation Medicine English Education in China,"BACKGROUND: Learning medical English is particularly challenging for non-native English-speaking medical students. The Smart Class teaching module is a new online teaching module for rehabilitation-related medical English, the efficacy of which has yet to be established in the literature. Gender differences should also not be ignored in our study, taking into account the proven performance differences between males and females in language learning. MATERIAL/METHODS: First-year physiotherapy students in Grade 2018 and Grade 2019 at Guangzhou Medical University were recruited to participate in this study. Grade 2019, as the experimental group, completed the Smart Class teaching module, while Grade 2018, as the control group, completed the Traditional Class teaching module. The efficacy of both modules was assessed objectively using the students’ medical English exam scores and subjectively using the students’ responses to a questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 242 questionnaires were distributed, and 210 valid questionnaires were returned, of which 119 were from the Smart Class teaching module group and 91 were from the Traditional Class teaching module group. There was no statistically significant difference between the medical English exam scores of the 2 groups (P=0.324). However, the subjective assessment revealed that the students experienced a significantly greater burden from the workload in the Smart Class teaching module group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found both the Smart Class teaching module and the Traditional Class teaching module achieved similar teaching outcomes. Therefore, the former represents a viable alternative teaching option for situations where traditional class teaching is not possible.",0,"The Smart Class Teaching Module for Rehabilitation Medicine English Education in China BACKGROUND: Learning medical English is particularly challenging for non-native English-speaking medical students.

Quality of Life and Coping in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Influence of Diabetes and Obesity,"Our aim was to analyze how type 2 diabetes and obesity influence quality of life (QoL) and coping in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and which coping strategies predict diabetic or obese participants’ QoL. QoL (SF-12, CLDQ-NAFLD) and coping strategies (COPE-28) were evaluated in 307 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients with absence or presence of diabetes or obesity. QoL was compared with normality tables for the general Spanish population. Interactive effects were found in physical functioning (p = 0.008), role-physical (p = 0.016) and activity (p = 0.014). Diabetic patients reported worse scores when they were also obese and vice versa, that is, obese patients scored worse when they were also diabetic. Both diabetic and obese patients had lower QoL than those without metabolic pathology or the general population, and obese patients also reported more passive/avoidance coping. Active coping, positive reframing and acceptance predicted better QoL, while denial, self-blame, self-distraction, disengagement and religion predicted lower QoL. In conclusion, diabetes and obesity were associated with lower QoL in patients with NAFLD. Obesity was also associated with more passive/avoidance coping. Furthermore, passive/avoidance coping strategies predicted lower QoL than active, recommending modification of maladaptive coping strategies in future multidisciplinary NAFLD treatments.",0,"Quality of Life and Coping in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Influence of Diabetes and Obesity Our aim was to analyze how type 2 diabetes and obesity influence quality of life (QoL) and coping in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and which coping strategies predict diabetic or obese participants’ QoL.

The Screening Research of NF-κB Inhibitors from Moutan Cortex Based on Bioactivity-Integrated UPLC-Q/TOF-MS,"Inflammation is a common and important pathological process, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a key mediator of it. Moutan Cortex (MC), the dried root cortex of Paeonia suffruticosa Andr., is widely used as a remedy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in Asian region. However, there are few studies on the systematic identification of NF-κB inhibitors of MC. In this study, the effect of inhibiting NF-κB activation of MC was assessed at the cellular level using a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced inflammatory model. Subsequently, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) combined with biological activity assay was established to screen and identify potential anti-inflammatory ingredients in MC. The results revealed that MC significantly inhibited the activation of NF-κB. Seven potential NF-κB inhibitors were screened from MC, including oxypaeoniflorin, paeoniflorin, galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, mudanpioside C, gallic acid, and paeonol. Among them, the NF-κB inhibitor activity of galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, and mudanpioside C is first reported here. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory activity of MC was associated with the seven components mentioned above.

A Social Media Campaign (#datasaveslives) to Promote the Benefits of Using Health Data for Research Purposes: Mixed Methods Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Social media provides the potential to engage a wide audience about scientific research, including the public. However, little empirical research exists to guide health scientists regarding what works and how to optimize impact. We examined the social media campaign #datasaveslives established in 2014 to highlight positive examples of the use and reuse of health data in research. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how the #datasaveslives hashtag was used on social media, how often, and by whom; thus, we aim to provide insights into the impact of a major social media campaign in the UK health informatics research community and further afield. METHODS: We analyzed all publicly available posts (tweets) that included the hashtag #datasaveslives (N=13,895) on the microblogging platform Twitter between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2017. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we determined the frequency and purpose of tweets. Social network analysis was used to analyze and visualize tweet sharing (retweet) networks among hashtag users. RESULTS: Overall, we found 4175 original posts and 9720 retweets featuring #datasaveslives by 3649 unique Twitter users. In total, 66.01% (2756/4175) of the original posts were retweeted at least once. Higher frequencies of tweets were observed during the weeks of prominent policy publications, popular conferences, and public engagement events. Cluster analysis based on retweet relationships revealed an interconnected series of groups of #datasaveslives users in academia, health services and policy, and charities and patient networks. Thematic analysis of tweets showed that #datasaveslives was used for a broader range of purposes than indexing information, including event reporting, encouraging participation and action, and showing personal support for data sharing. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a hashtag-based social media campaign was effective in encouraging a wide audience of stakeholders to disseminate positive examples of health research. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the campaign supported community building and bridging practices within and between the interdisciplinary sectors related to the field of health data science and encouraged individuals to demonstrate personal support for sharing health data.",0,"A Social Media Campaign (#datasaveslives) to Promote the Benefits of Using Health Data for Research Purposes: Mixed Methods Analysis BACKGROUND: Social media provides the potential to engage a wide audience about scientific research, including the public.

Silencing of lncRNA MIAT alleviates LPS-induced pneumonia via regulating miR-147a/NKAP/NF-κB axis,"Purpose: Pneumonia is a respiratory disease with an increasing incidence in recent years. More and more studies have revealed that lncRNAs can regulate the transcriptional expression of target genes at different stage. Herein, we aimed to explore the effect of lncRNA MIAT in LPS-induced pneumonia, and further illuminate the possible underlying mechanisms. Method and results: Mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS, and the lung inflammation was evaluated. Microarray showed lncRNA MIAT was up-regulated in LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. And qRT-PCR and FISH assay indicated that MIAT was increased in mice with LPS injection. Functional analysis showed sh-MIAT inhibited LPS-induced inflammation response, inhibited apoptosis level and protected lung function. As well, si-MIAT removed the injury of LPS on mouse lung epithelial TC-1 cells, and inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, MIAT acted as a sponge of miR-147a, and miR-147a directly targeted NKAP. Functionally, AMO-147a or NKAP remitted the beneficial effects of si-MIAT on LPS-induced inflammation response of TC-1 cells.

Organoids in Translational Oncology,"Translational medicine aims to translate the most promising preclinical research into clinical practice. Oncology is a continuously growing medical field: the scientific research on cancer biology is currently based on in vitro experiments, carried out on tissue culture plates (TCPs) and other 2D samples. In this context, 3D printing has greatly improved the biofabrication of new biological matrices that mimic the extracellular environments, which may characterize healthy from cancerous tissues.

Simian virus 40 vectors for pulmonary gene therapy,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. One of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung, presenting as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression, making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality. This work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy. METHODS: Sepsis-induced ARDS was established by cecal ligation double puncture (2CLP). SV40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene (SV/luc) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction. Sham operated (SO) as well as 2CLP rats given intratracheal PBS or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls. Luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection, immunoassay and luciferase mRNA detection by RT-PCR in tissue harvested from septic rats. Vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the SV40 VP1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for VP1 and for the surfactant protein C (proSP-C). Immunostaining for T-lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector. RESULTS: Luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats. Moreover, our results showed vector presence in type II alveolar cells. The vector did not induce significant cellular immune response. CONCLUSION: In the present study we have demonstrated efficient uptake and expression of an SV40 vector in the lungs of animals with sepsis-induced ARDS. These vectors appear to be capable of in vivo transduction of alveolar type II cells and may thus become a future therapeutic tool.",0,"Simian virus 40 vectors for pulmonary gene therapy BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients.

Status and gaps of research on respiratory disease pathogens of swine in Africa,"Over the last two decades, the pig population in Africa has grown rapidly, reflecting the increased adoption of pig production as an important economic activity. Of all species, pigs are likely to constitute a greater share of the growth in the livestock subsector. However, constraints such as respiratory infectious diseases cause significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Compared to industrialized countries, the occurrence and impacts of respiratory diseases on pig production in Africa is under-documented. Hence, knowledge on prevalence and incidence of economically important swine respiratory pathogens in pigs in Africa is necessary to guide interventions for prevention and control. The purpose of this review was to document the current status of research on five important respiratory pathogens of swine in Africa to inform future research and interventions. The pathogens included were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSv), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). For this review, published articles were obtained using Harzing’s Publish or Perish software tool from GoogleScholar. Articles were also sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, FAO and OIE websites. The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae.

Making Universal Influenza Vaccines: Lessons From the 1918 Pandemic,"The year 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history. In 1918–1919, pandemic influenza spread globally and caused an estimated 50–100 million deaths associated with unexpected clinical and epidemiological features. The descendants of the 1918 virus continue to circulate as annual epidemic viruses causing significant mortality each year. The 1918 influenza pandemic serves as a benchmark for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Challenges to producing a truly universal influenza vaccine include eliciting broad protection against antigenically different influenza viruses that can prevent or significantly downregulate viral replication and reduce morbidity by preventing development of viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia.

"Oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir as influenza prophylaxis in Thai health workers: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial over 16 weeks","OBJECTIVES: Long-term chemoprophylaxis using neuraminidase inhibitors may be needed during influenza epidemics but safety data are limited to several weeks. We sought to assess the tolerability of oseltamivir and zanamivir as primary prophylaxis over 16 weeks. METHODS: We conducted a parallel group, double blind, 2 (active drug) :1 (placebo) randomized trial of oral oseltamivir/placebo or inhaled zanamivir/placebo over 16 weeks in healthy, Thai hospital professionals at two Bangkok hospitals. The primary endpoint was study withdrawal due to drug-related (possibly, probably, definitely) serious or adverse events (AEs) graded ≥2. RESULTS: Recruited subjects numbered 129 oseltamivir/65 placebo and 131 zanamivir/65 placebo. A total of 102 grade ≥2 AEs were reported or detected in 69 subjects: 23/129 (17.8%) versus 15/65 (23.1%) (P = 0.26), and 23/131 (17.6%) versus 8/65 (12.3%) (P = 0.28). Intercurrent infections/fevers [26/102 (25.5%)], abnormal biochemistry [25/102 (24.5%)] and gastrointestinal symptoms [18/102 (17.6%)] were the most frequently reported AEs. There were no drug-related study withdrawals. Eight serious AEs were all due to intercurrent illnesses. Laboratory, lung function and ECG parameters were similar between drugs and placebos.

A Single Immunization with Soluble Recombinant Trimeric Hemagglutinin Protects Chickens against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1,"BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In addition, it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH5(3)) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH5(3) was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dose-dependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH5(3) provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that sH5(3) constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1. As these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time, they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.",0,"A Single Immunization with Soluble Recombinant Trimeric Hemagglutinin Protects Chickens against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry.

"Human bocaviruses are highly diverse, dispersed, recombination prone, and prevalent enteric infections","A new species of parvovirus tentatively named human bocavirus 4 (HBoV4) was genetically characterized. Among 641 feces samples from children and adults the most commonly detected bocaviruses species were HBoV2>HBoV3>HBoV4>HBoV1 with HBoV2 prevalence of 21% and 26% in Nigerian and Tunisian children. HBoV3 and HBoV4 species combined were found in 12/192 cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Tunisia and Nigeria and 0/96 healthy Tunisian contacts (p=0.01). Evidence of extensive recombination at the NP1 and VP1 gene boundary between and within species was found. The multiple species and high degree of genetic diversity seen among the human bocaviruses found in feces relative to the highly homogeneous HBoV1 suggest that this world-wide distributed respiratory pathogen may have recently evolved from an enteric bocavirus, perhaps after acquiring an expanded tropism favoring the respiratory track. Elucidating the possible role of the newly identified enteric bocaviruses in human diseases including AFP and diarrhea will require further epidemiological studies.",0,"Human bocaviruses are highly diverse, dispersed, recombination prone, and prevalent enteric infections A new species of parvovirus tentatively named human bocavirus 4 (HBoV4) was genetically characterized.

Quality control of multiplex antibody detection in samples from large-scale surveys: the example of malaria in Haiti,"Measuring antimalarial antibodies can estimate transmission in a population. To compare outputs, standardized laboratory testing is required. Here we describe the in-country establishment and quality control (QC) of a multiplex bead assay (MBA) for three sero-surveys in Haiti. Total IgG data against 21 antigens were collected for 32,758 participants. Titration curves of hyperimmune sera were included on assay plates, assay signals underwent 5-parameter regression, and inspection of the median and interquartile range (IQR) for the y-inflection point was used to determine assay precision. The medians and IQRs were similar for Surveys 1 and 2 for most antigens, while the IQRs increased for some antigens in Survey 3. Levey-Jennings charts for selected antigens provided a pass/fail criterion for each assay plate and, of 387 assay plates, 13 (3.4%) were repeated. Individual samples failed if IgG binding to the generic glutathione-S-transferase protein was observed, with 659 (2.0%) samples failing. An additional 455 (1.4%) observations failed due to low bead numbers (<20/analyte). The final dataset included 609,438 anti-malaria IgG data points from 32,099 participants; 96.6% of all potential data points if no QC failures had occurred. The MBA can be deployed with high-throughput data collection and low inter-plate variability while ensuring data quality.",0,"Quality control of multiplex antibody detection in samples from large-scale surveys: the example of malaria in Haiti Measuring antimalarial antibodies can estimate transmission in a population.

Tolerance and autoimmunity in TCR transgenic mice specific for myelin basic protein,"Summary: T‐cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice provide the ability to follow the maturation and fate of T cells specific for self‐antigens in vivo. This technology represents a major breakthrough in the study of autoimmune diseases in which specific antigens have been implicated. Proteins expressed within the central nervous system are believed to be important autoantigens in multiple sclerosis, TCR transgenic models specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) allowed us to assess the role of tolerance in providing protection from T cells with this specificity Our studies demonstrate that T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope of MBP do not undergo tolerance in vivo and that TCR transgenic mice are susceptible to spontaneous autoimmune disease. The susceptibility to spontaneous disease is dependent on exposure to microbial antigens, MBP TCR transgenic models expressing TCRs specific for the same epitope of MBP but utilizing different V(α) genes exhibit differing susceptibilities to, spontaneous disease. These data support the idea that genetic and environmental differences play a role in susceptibility to autoimmunity MBP TCR transgenic models are playing an important role in defining mechanisms by which infectious agents trigger autoimmune disease as well as defining mechanisms by which tolerance is induced to distinct epitopes within self‐antigens.",0,"Tolerance and autoimmunity in TCR transgenic mice specific for myelin basic protein Summary: T‐cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice provide the ability to follow the maturation and fate of T cells specific for self‐antigens in vivo.

The cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Cytotoxicity requires proteolytic activation,"The primary structure of a cytotoxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined by sequencing of the structural gene. The cytotoxin (31,700 Mr) lacks an N-terminal signal sequence for bacterial secretion but contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence commonly found in prokaryotic proteins which function in a TonB-dependent manner. The cytotoxin gene has a [G+C]-content of 53.8% which is considerably lower than generally observed for genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cytotoxin gene was exclusively detected in strain 158 but not in three other clinical isolates, as determined by Southern and Northern hybridization. The latter technique revealed that the toxin is translated from monocistronic mRNA. The promoter of the cytotoxin is inactive in Escherichia coli. Upon site-directed modification of the 5′-noncoding region by the polymerase chain reaction the gene was expressed under control of the trcpromoter. The gene product obtained in Escherichia coli was nontoxic. Toxicity was induced by subsequent treatment with trypsin. [(35)S]methionine-labeled cytotoxin with high specific radioactivity was obtained by in vitro transcription/translation.

"Mortality, morbidity and health in developed societies: a review of data sources","The purpose of this paper is to review the major sources of data on mortality, morbidity and health in Europe and in other developed regions in order to examine their potential for analysing mortality and morbidity levels and trends. The review is primarily focused on routinely collected information covering a whole country. No attempt is made to draw up an inventory of sources by country; the paper deals instead with the pros and cons of each source for mortality and morbidity studies in demography. While each source considered separately can already yield useful, though partial, results, record linkage among data sources can significantly improve the analysis. Record linkage can also lead to the detection of possible causal associations that could eventually be confirmed. More generally, Big Data can reveal changing mortality and morbidity trends and patterns that could lead to preventive measures being taken rather than more costly curative ones.",0,"Mortality, morbidity and health in developed societies: a review of data sources The purpose of this paper is to review the major sources of data on mortality, morbidity and health in Europe and in other developed regions in order to examine their potential for analysing mortality and morbidity levels and trends.

A novel epitope-blocking ELISA for specific and sensitive detection of antibodies against H5-subtype influenza virus hemagglutinin,"BACKGROUND: H5-subtype highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza viruses (AIVs) cause high mortality in domestic birds and sporadic infections in humans with a frequently fatal outcome, while H5N1 viruses have pandemic potential. Due to veterinary and public health significance, these HPAIVs, as well as low pathogenicity (LP) H5-subtype AIVs having a propensity to mutate into HP viruses, are under epidemiologic surveillance and must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Our previous work provided a unique panel of 6 different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against H5 hemagglutinin (HA), which meets the demand for high-specificity tools for monitoring AIV infection and vaccination in poultry. In this study, we selected one of these mAbs to develop an epitope-blocking (EB) ELISA for detecting H5 subtype-specific antibodies in chicken sera (H5 EB-ELISA). METHODS: In the H5 EB-ELISA, H5 HA protein produced in a baculovirus-expression vector system was employed as a coating antigen, and the G-7-27-18 mAb was employed as a blocking antibody. The performance characteristics of the assay were evaluated by testing 358 sera from nonimmunized chickens and chickens immunized with AIVs of the H1–H16 subtypes or recombinant H5 HA antigen to obtain the reference and experimental antisera, respectively. The samples were classified as anti-H5 HA positive or negative based on the results of the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the gold standard in subtype-specific serodiagnosis. RESULTS: The H5 EB-ELISA correctly discriminated between the anti-H5 HA negative sera, including those against the non-H5 subtype AIVs, and sera positive for antibodies against the various-origin H5 HAs. Preliminary validation showed 100% analytical and 97.6% diagnostic specificities of the assay and 98.0% and 99.1% diagnostic sensitivities when applied to detect the anti-H5 HA antibodies in the reference and experimental antisera, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The H5 EB-ELISA performed well in terms of diagnostic estimates. Thus, further optimization and validation work using a larger set of chicken sera and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are warranted. Moreover, the present assay provides a valuable basis for developing multispecies screening tests for birds or diagnostic tests for humans.

Food Innovation Adoption and Organic Food Consumerism—A Cross National Study between Malaysia and Hungary,"In order to meet the rising global demand for food and to ensure food security in line with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 2, technological advances have been introduced in the food production industry. The organic food industry has benefitted from advances in food technology and innovation. However, there remains skepticism regarding organic foods on the part of consumers, specifically on consumers’ acceptance of food innovation technologies used in the production of organic foods. This study measured factors that influence consumers’ food innovation adoption and subsequently their intention to purchase organic foods. We compared the organic foods purchase behavior of Malaysian and Hungarian consumers to examine differences between Asian and European consumers. The findings show food innovation adoption as the most crucial predictor for the intention to purchase organic foods in Hungary, while social lifestyle factor was the most influential in Malaysia. Other factors such as environmental concerns and health consciousness were also examined in relation to food innovation adoption and organic food consumerism.

Machine learning algorithm to predict mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy,"BACKGROUND: Previous scoring models such as the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring systems do not adequately predict mortality of patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for severe acute kidney injury. Accordingly, the present study applies machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy for this patient subset. METHODS: We randomly divided a total of 1571 adult patients who started CRRT for acute kidney injury into training (70%, n = 1094) and test (30%, n = 477) sets. The primary output consisted of the probability of mortality during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of several machine learning algorithms with that of the APACHE II, SOFA, and the new abbreviated mortality scoring system for acute kidney injury with CRRT (MOSAIC model) results. RESULTS: For the ICU mortality, the random forest model showed the highest AUC (0.784 [0.744–0.825]), and the artificial neural network and extreme gradient boost models demonstrated the next best results (0.776 [0.735–0.818]). The AUC of the random forest model was higher than 0.611 (0.583–0.640), 0.677 (0.651–0.703), and 0.722 (0.677–0.767), as achieved by APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC, respectively. The machine learning models also predicted in-hospital mortality better than APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC.

"Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Management, Outcomes","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenetic diseases worldwide and is attributable to significant morbidity and mortality. Mutations causing abnormal hemoglobin formation in this disease lead to structural abnormalities and cumulative damage to the cellular membrane of sickled erythrocytes. Polymerization and aggregation of these cells within the microvasculature results in severe vaso-occlusive pain crisis, chronic hemolytic anemia, and multiorgan pathology in patients. Pulmonary manifestations of SCD, including the acute chest syndrome (ACS), are a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality. ACS is a severe type of acute lung injury, defined as the development of a new pulmonary infiltrate, involving at least one complete lung segment, that is accompanied by fever, chest pain, tachypnea, wheezing, or cough in a patient with SCD. The etiology of ACS is multifactorial, with the most common mechanisms including infection, fat and bone marrow embolism, and direct microvascular vaso-occlusion. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical management of ACS in SCD, patient outcomes remain unacceptably poor. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of ACS in SCD.

"Etiology, Clinical Profile, Evaluation, and Management of Stridor in Children","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate various causes of pediatric stridor and their management among admitted patients in last 2 y. METHODS: Retrospective study of 67 stridor cases in pediatric age group (from birth to 18 y), admitted to the Department of Pediatrics and ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) from May 2018 to April 2020 were included in the study. Data were obtained from medical records regarding age, gender, clinical presentation, and management. RESULTS: Out of 67 cases of pediatric stridor, 28.3% were infants, 50.7% were between 1 to 5 y, while 20.9% were between 5 to 18 y. Foreign body trachea (FB) was the most common (38.8%) cause of stridor. The commonest cause of stridor among infants was laryngomalacia (47.4%) while FB trachea (55.9%) was the commonest cause among 1 to 5 y age group. In age group between 5 to 18 y, peritonsillar abscess and bacterial tracheitis (21.4% each) were found to be the most common. Primary management with securing of airways were done in all cases. Curative treatment was provided according to the underlying pathology. Eight patients (11.9%) required tracheostomy to bypass airway obstruction. There was no mortality in the present study population. CONCLUSION: Pediatric stridor management is a teamwork between ENT surgeons, pediatricians, and anaesthetists. Management starts with suspicion from history followed by clinical and radiological evaluation. Securing airway is of utmost importance and precise management of cause is carried out later.",0,"Etiology, Clinical Profile, Evaluation, and Management of Stridor in Children OBJECTIVE: To evaluate various causes of pediatric stridor and their management among admitted patients in last 2 y.

In age group between 5 to 18 y, peritonsillar abscess and bacterial tracheitis (21.4% each) were found to be the most common. Primary management with securing of airways were done in all cases. Curative treatment was provided according to the underlying pathology. Eight patients (11.9%) required tracheostomy to bypass airway obstruction. There was no mortality in the present study population. CONCLUSION: Pediatric stridor management is a teamwork between ENT surgeons, pediatricians, and anaesthetists. Management starts with suspicion from history followed by clinical and radiological evaluation. Securing airway is of utmost importance and precise management of cause is carried out later.",etiology clinical profile evaluation and management of stridor in children objective to evaluate various causes of pediatric stridor and their management among admitted patients in last 2 y methods retrospective study of 67 stridor cases in pediatric age group from birth to 18 y admitted to the department of pediatrics and ent ear nose and throat from may 2018 to april 2020 were included in the study data were obtained from medical records regarding age gender clinical presentation and management results out of 67 cases of pediatric stridor 283 were infants 507 were between 1 to 5 y while 209 were between 5 to 18 y foreign body trachea fb was the most common 388 cause of stridor the commonest cause of stridor among infants was laryngomalacia 474 while fb trachea 559 was the commonest cause among 1 to 5 y age group in age group between 5 to 18 y peritonsillar abscess and bacterial tracheitis 214 each were found to be the most common primary management with securing of airways were done in all cases curative treatment was provided according to the underlying pathology eight patients 119 required tracheostomy to bypass airway obstruction there was no mortality in the present study population conclusion pediatric stridor management is a teamwork between ent surgeons pediatricians and anaesthetists management starts with suspicion from history followed by clinical and radiological evaluation securing airway is of utmost importance and precise management of cause is carried out later,1
