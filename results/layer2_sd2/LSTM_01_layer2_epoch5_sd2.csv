Assessing and decomposing inequality of opportunity in access to child health and nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa: evidence from three countries with low human development index,"BACKGROUND: Inequality of opportunity in health and nutrition is a major public health issue in the developing regions. This study analyzed the patterns and extent of inequality of opportunity in health and nutrition among children under-five across three countries sub-Saharan Africa with low Human development index (HDI). METHODS: We used data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of the Democratic Republic of Congo (20,792 households, 21,756 women aged 15 to 49 and 21,456 children under five), Guinea Bissau (6601 households, 10,234 women aged 15–49 and 7573 children under five) and Mali (11,830 households, 18,409 women in 15–49 years and 16,468 children under five) to compute the human opportunity index (HOI) and the dissimilarity index (D-index). Secondly, the Shapley decomposition method was used to estimate the relative contribution of circumstances that are beyond the control of children under-five and affecting their development outcomes in later life stages. RESULTS: The study revealed that children belonging to the most favorable group had higher access rates for immunization (93.64%) and water and sanitation facilities (73.59%) in Guinea Bissau. In Congo DR, the access rate was high for immunization (93.9%) for children in the most favorable group. In Mali, access rates stood at 6.56% for children in the most favorable group. In Guinea Bissau, the inequality of opportunity was important in access to health services before and after delivery (43.85%). In Congo DR, the inequality of opportunity was only high for the immunization composite indicator (83.79%) while in Mali, inequality of opportunity was higher for access to health services before and after delivery (41.67%). CONCLUSION: The results show that there are efforts in some places to promote access to health and nutrition services in order to make access equal without distinction linked to the socio-economic and demographic characteristics in which the children live. However, the inequalities of opportunity observed between the children of the most favorable group and those of the least favorable group, remain in general at significant levels and call on government of these countries to implement policies taking them into account.",0,"Assessing and decomposing inequality of opportunity in access to child health and nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa: evidence from three countries with low human development index BACKGROUND: Inequality of opportunity in health and nutrition is a major public health issue in the developing regions.

Characteristics and resolution of hypertension in obese African American bariatric cohort,"Weight reduction continues to be first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension (HTN). However, the long-term effect of bariatric malabsorptive surgical techniques such as Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery in the management of hypertension (HTN) is less clear. African Americans (AA) are disproportionately affected by obesity and hypertension and have inconsistent outcomes after bariatric surgery (BS). Despite a plethora of bariatric literature, data about characteristics of a predominantly AA bariatric hypertensive cohort including hypertension in obese (HIO) are scarce and underreported. The aims of this study were, (1) to describe the preoperative clinical characteristics of HIO with respect to HTN status and age, and (2) to identify predictors of HTN resolution one year after RYGB surgery in an AA bariatric cohort enrolled at the Howard University Center for Wellness and Weight Loss Surgery (HUCWWS). In the review of 169 AA bariatric patients, the average BMI was 48.50 kg/m(2) and the average age was 43.86 years. Obese hypertensive patients were older (46 years vs. 37.89 years; p < .0001); had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, 43.09% vs. 10.87%; p < .0001) and dyslipidemia (38.2% vs. 13.04%; p 0.002). Hypertensive AA who were taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications prior to RYGB were 18 times less likely to experience HTN resolution compared to hypertensive AA taking 0–1 medications, who showed full or partial response. Also, HIO was less likely to resolve after RYGB surgery in patients who needed ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications prior to surgical intervention.",0,"Characteristics and resolution of hypertension in obese African American bariatric cohort Weight reduction continues to be first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension (HTN).

Postnatal steroid management in preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly affecting extremely preterm infants. Although mechanical ventilation and oxygen requirements in premature infants are identified as inciting mechanisms for inflammation and the development of BPD over time, data now support an array of perinatal events that may stimulate the inflammatory cascade prior to delivery. Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, have proven beneficial for the prevention and management of BPD postnatally due to their anti-inflammatory characteristics. This review aims to examine the pharmacologic properties of several corticosteroids, appraise the existing evidence for postnatal corticosteroid use in preterm infants, and assess steroid management strategies to ameliorate BPD. Finally, we aim to provide guidance based on clinical experience for managing adrenal suppression resulting from prolonged steroid exposure since this is an area less well-studied.",0,"Postnatal steroid management in preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly affecting extremely preterm infants.

Adult bacterial nasopharyngitis: A clinical entity?,"Objective: To investigate bacterial nasopharyngitis as a cause of adult upper respiratory infection. Design: Prospective case series. Setting: Walk-in medical clinic of a university hospital. Patients: 507 patients with cold or flu symptoms, sore throat, or recent cough; 21 control subjects without symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Measurements and main results: After thorough history and physical examination, the patients underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration and throat culture. Nasopharyngeal specimens were cultured for both bacteria and viruses; antigens for influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were sought by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); serum antibodies to viral respiratory pathogens were determined. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci grew from the throat specimens of 39 of the 507 patients (8%) or 38 of 3 34 patients (11%) who had clinical diagnoses of pharyngitis. Thirty-three cases of influenza A, 20 cases of influenza B, and seven cases of parainfluenza infections were diagnosed. Bacteria were cultured from the nasopharyngeal secretions of 284 patients (56%). In contrast to pharyngeal culture, commensal mixed flora were rarely found in nasopharyngeal culture. Nasopharyngeal culture of bacteria usually considered to be respiratory pathogens was significantly associated with the presence of leukocytes.Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio 6.0, 95% confidence interval 2.6–14.2),Moraxella catarrbalis (odds ratio 12.9, 95% confidence interval 3.1–79.5), andHemophilus influenzae (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2–7.4) were all associated with the presence of leukocytes. In contrast, nasophaiyngeal culture of coagulase-negative staphylococci, mixed flora, and the documentation of a viral infection were not associated with the presence of leukocytes. For none of 21 control subjects were “pathogenic” bacteria found. Conclusions: These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria may have a causal role in adult nasopharyngitis, although further data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",0,"Adult bacterial nasopharyngitis: A clinical entity?

Reporting of acute pancreatitis by radiologists-time for a systematic change with structured reporting template,Acute pancreatitis has a wide array of imaging presentations. Various classifications have been used in the past to standardize the terminology and reduce confusing and redundant terms. We aim to review the historical and current classifications of acute pancreatitis and propose a new reporting template which can improve communication between various medical teams by use of appropriate terminology and structured radiology template. The standardized reporting template not only conveys the most important imaging findings in a simplified yet comprehensive way but also allows structured data collection for future research and teaching purposes.,0,Reporting of acute pancreatitis by radiologists-time for a systematic change with structured reporting template Acute pancreatitis has a wide array of imaging presentations.

Use of social media in food safety in Saudi Arabia—a preliminary study,"Over the past two decades, the rapid rise of social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information online. Social media platforms are not now only used extensively by individuals but also by businesses, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and many other organizations to deliver information to the public and, in return, collect information from that same audience. The preliminary study presented here offers valuable insights into how social media may be used to improve food safety standards. Today, food safety is still a major health challenge in the country, which occasionally faces unsafe food supply chains, an increased number of food borne outbreaks, and poor hygiene education. Social media may be used as a very valuable tool for people to access important information and more knowledge about food safety. The limited-scope survey presented here was conducted over the western part of Saudi Arabia and included 295 individuals of both genders, among various age groups. Participants responded to an online questionnaire about their use of social media to obtain information about food safety. Results showed that social media was indeed a major outlet for individuals to access information on food safety, with the top-ranked social media platforms being WhatsApp (M = 2.99) followed by Snapchat (M = 3.72), YouTube (M = 4.08), Instagram (M = 4.46), and Facebook (M = 4.81). Additionally, we found that the most trusted sources of information was the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (72.6%) and the Saudi Ministry of Health (55.4%). Participants most frequently sought epidemiological information (52.5%), quantitative risk estimates (23.1%), and information on the various types of foodborne infections (15.3%); they preferred the information to be in video format (67.5%), articles (57.6%), infographics (55.3%).

Dietary Patterns Derived from UK Supermarket Transaction Data with Nutrient and Socioeconomic Profiles,"Poor diet is a leading cause of death in the United Kingdom (UK) and around the world. Methods to collect quality dietary information at scale for population research are time consuming, expensive and biased. Novel data sources offer potential to overcome these challenges and better understand population dietary patterns. In this research we will use 12 months of supermarket sales transaction data, from 2016, for primary shoppers residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region of the UK (n = 299,260), to identify dietary patterns and profile these according to their nutrient composition and the sociodemographic characteristics of the consumer purchasing with these patterns. Results identified seven dietary purchase patterns that we named: Fruity; Meat alternatives; Carnivores; Hydrators; Afternoon tea; Beer and wine lovers; and Sweet tooth. On average the daily energy intake of loyalty card holders -who may buy as an individual or for a household- is less than the adult reference intake, but this varies according to dietary purchase pattern. In general loyalty card holders meet the recommended salt intake, do not purchase enough carbohydrates, and purchase too much fat and protein, but not enough fibre. The dietary purchase pattern containing the highest amount of fibre (as an indicator of healthiness) is bought by the least deprived customers and the pattern with lowest fibre by the most deprived.

Association of Infectious Disease Physician Approval of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter With Appropriateness and Complications,"IMPORTANCE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are frequently used to deliver intravenous antimicrobial therapy. However, inappropriate PICC use may lead to patient harm. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of 21 653 PICCs placed for a primary indication of intravenous antimicrobial therapy between January 1, 2015, and July 26, 2019, was conducted in 42 hospitals participating in a quality collaborative across Michigan among hospitalized medical patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Appropriateness of PICCs was defined according to the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters as a composite measure of (1) single-lumen catheter use, (2) avoiding use of PICCs for 5 days or less, and (3) avoiding use of PICCs for patients with chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Complications related to PICCs included catheter occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, and central line–associated bloodstream infection. The association between infectious disease physician approval, device appropriateness, and catheter complications was assessed using multivariable models, adjusted for patient comorbidities and hospital clustering. Results were expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 21 653 PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobials (11 960 PICCs were placed in men [55.2%]; median age, 64.5 years [interquartile range, 53.4-75.4 years]); 10 238 PICCs (47.3%) were approved by an infectious disease physician prior to placement. Compared with PICCs with no documented approval, PICCs with approval by an infectious disease physician were more likely to be appropriately used (72.7% [7446 of 10 238] appropriate with approval vs 45.4% [5180 of 11 415] appropriate without approval; odds ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.29-3.79; P < .001). Furthermore, approval was associated with lower odds of a PICC-related complication (6.5% [665 of 10 238] with approval vs 11.3% [1292 of 11 415] without approval; odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.50-0.61). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that, when PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobial therapy, infectious disease physician approval of PICC insertion was associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications.

However, inappropriate PICC use may lead to patient harm. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of 21 653 PICCs placed for a primary indication of intravenous antimicrobial therapy between January 1, 2015, and July 26, 2019, was conducted in 42 hospitals participating in a quality collaborative across Michigan among hospitalized medical patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Appropriateness of PICCs was defined according to the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters as a composite measure of (1) single-lumen catheter use, (2) avoiding use of PICCs for 5 days or less, and (3) avoiding use of PICCs for patients with chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Complications related to PICCs included catheter occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, and central line–associated bloodstream infection. The association between infectious disease physician approval, device appropriateness, and catheter complications was assessed using multivariable models, adjusted for patient comorbidities and hospital clustering. Results were expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 21 653 PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobials (11 960 PICCs were placed in men [55.2%]; median age, 64.5 years [interquartile range, 53.4-75.4 years]); 10 238 PICCs (47.3%) were approved by an infectious disease physician prior to placement.

Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease,"Carefully calibrated transmission models have the potential to guide public health officials on the nature and scale of the interventions required to control epidemics. In the context of the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, Drake and colleagues, in this issue of PLOS Biology, employed an elegant modeling approach to capture the distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community and health care settings in the context of changing population behaviors and increasing hospital capacity. Their findings underscore the role of increasing the rate of safe burials and the fractions of infectious individuals who seek hospitalization together with hospital capacity to achieve epidemic control. However, further modeling efforts of EVD transmission and control in West Africa should utilize the spatial-temporal patterns of spread in the region by incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the transmission process. Detailed datasets are urgently needed to characterize temporal changes in population behaviors, contact networks at different spatial scales, population mobility patterns, adherence to infection control measures in hospital settings, and hospitalization and reporting rates.",0,"Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease Carefully calibrated transmission models have the potential to guide public health officials on the nature and scale of the interventions required to control epidemics.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 represses endothelial-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting IL-1β/NF-κB/Snail signaling,"Endothelial–mesenchymal transition (EnMT) plays a pivotal role in various diseases, including pulmonary hypertension (PH), and transcription factors like Snail are key regulators of EnMT. In this study we investigated how these factors were regulated by PH risk factors (e.g. inflammation and hypoxia) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We showed that treatment with interleukin 1β (IL‐1β) induced EnMT of HUVECs via activation of NF-κB/Snail pathway, which was further exacerbated by knockdown of protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 (PTPL1). We demonstrated that PTPL1 inhibited NF-κB/Snail through dephosphorylating and stabilizing IκBα. IL‐1β or hypoxia could downregulate PTPL1 expression in HUVECs. The deregulation of PTPL1/NF-κB signaling was validated in a monocrotaline-induced rat PH (MCT-PH) model and clinical PH specimens. Our findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of EnMT, and have implications for identifying new therapeutic targets for clinical PH.",0,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 represses endothelial-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting IL-1β/NF-κB/Snail signaling Endothelial–mesenchymal transition (EnMT) plays a pivotal role in various diseases, including pulmonary hypertension (PH), and transcription factors like Snail are key regulators of EnMT.

CladeOScope: functional interactions through the prism of clade-wise co-evolution,"Mapping co-evolved genes via phylogenetic profiling (PP) is a powerful approach to uncover functional interactions between genes and to associate them with pathways. Despite many successful endeavors, the understanding of co-evolutionary signals in eukaryotes remains partial. Our hypothesis is that ‘Clades’, branches of the tree of life (e.g. primates and mammals), encompass signals that cannot be detected by PP using all eukaryotes. As such, integrating information from different clades should reveal local co-evolution signals and improve function prediction. Accordingly, we analyzed 1028 genomes in 66 clades and demonstrated that the co-evolutionary signal was scattered across clades. We showed that functionally related genes are frequently co-evolved in only parts of the eukaryotic tree and that clades are complementary in detecting functional interactions within pathways. We examined the non-homologous end joining pathway and the UFM1 ubiquitin-like protein pathway and showed that both demonstrated distinguished co-evolution patterns in specific clades. Our research offers a different way to look at co-evolution across eukaryotes and points to the importance of modular co-evolution analysis. We developed the ‘CladeOScope’ PP method to integrate information from 16 clades across over 1000 eukaryotic genomes and is accessible via an easy to use web server at http://cladeoscope.cs.huji.ac.il.",0,"CladeOScope: functional interactions through the prism of clade-wise co-evolution Mapping co-evolved genes via phylogenetic profiling (PP) is a powerful approach to uncover functional interactions between genes and to associate them with pathways.

Epidemic Spread on One-Way Circular-Coupled Networks,"Real epidemic spreading networks are often composed of several kinds of complex networks interconnected with each other, such as Lyme disease, and the interrelated networks may have different topologies and epidemic dynamics. Moreover, most human infectious diseases are derived from animals, and zoonotic infections always spread on directed interconnected networks. So, in this article, we consider the epidemic dynamics of zoonotic infections on a unidirectional circular-coupled network. Here, we construct two unidirectional three-layer circular interactive networks, one model has direct contact between interactive networks, the other model describes diseases transmitted through vectors between interactive networks, which are established by introducing the heterogeneous mean-field approach method. Then we obtain the basic reproduction numbers and stability of equilibria of the two models. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, it is found that basic reproduction numbers of the models depend on the infection rates, infection periods, average degrees, and degree ratios. Numerical simulations illustrate and expand these theoretical results very well.",0,"Epidemic Spread on One-Way Circular-Coupled Networks Real epidemic spreading networks are often composed of several kinds of complex networks interconnected with each other, such as Lyme disease, and the interrelated networks may have different topologies and epidemic dynamics.

Health System Resource Gaps and Associated Mortality from Pandemic Influenza across Six Asian Territories,"BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia has been the focus of considerable investment in pandemic influenza preparedness. Given the wide variation in socio-economic conditions, health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations. We aimed to estimate and compare the resource gaps, and potential mortalities associated with those gaps, for responding to pandemic influenza within and between six territories in Asia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected health system resource data from Cambodia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali), Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. We applied a mathematical transmission model to simulate a “mild-to-moderate” pandemic influenza scenario to estimate resource needs, gaps, and attributable mortalities at province level within each territory. The results show that wide variations exist in resource capacities between and within the six territories, with substantial mortalities predicted as a result of resource gaps (referred to here as “avoidable” mortalities), particularly in poorer areas. Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators were estimated to be a major cause of avoidable mortalities in all territories except Taiwan. Other resources (oseltamivir, hospital beds and human resources) are inequitably distributed within countries. Estimates of resource gaps and avoidable mortalities were highly sensitive to model parameters defining the transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic scenario. However, geographic patterns observed within and across territories remained similar for the range of parameter values explored. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for where (both geographically and in terms of which resource types) investment is most needed, and the potential impact of resource mobilization for mitigating the disease burden of an influenza pandemic. Effective mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could go some way towards minimizing avoidable deaths.",0,"Health System Resource Gaps and Associated Mortality from Pandemic Influenza across Six Asian Territories BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia has been the focus of considerable investment in pandemic influenza preparedness.

Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks,"In this study, we present representative human contact networks among Chinese college students. Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period. Our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control.",0,"Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks In this study, we present representative human contact networks among Chinese college students.

Timeliness of contact tracing among flight passengers for influenza A/H1N1 2009,"BACKGROUND: During the initial containment phase of influenza A/H1N1 2009, close contacts of cases were traced to provide antiviral prophylaxis within 48 h after exposure and to alert them on signs of disease for early diagnosis and treatment. Passengers seated on the same row, two rows in front or behind a patient infectious for influenza, during a flight of ≥ 4 h were considered close contacts. This study evaluates the timeliness of flight-contact tracing (CT) as performed following national and international CT requests addressed to the Center of Infectious Disease Control (CIb/RIVM), and implemented by the Municipal Health Services of Schiphol Airport. METHODS: Elapsed days between date of flight arrival and the date passenger lists became available (contact details identified - CI) was used as proxy for timeliness of CT. In a retrospective study, dates of flight arrival, onset of illness, laboratory diagnosis, CT request and identification of contacts details through passenger lists, following CT requests to the RIVM for flights landed at Schiphol Airport were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 24 requests for CT were identified. Three of these were declined as over 4 days had elapsed since flight arrival. In 17 out of 21 requests, contact details were obtained within 7 days after arrival (81%). The average delay between arrival and CI was 3,9 days (range 2-7), mainly caused by delay in diagnosis of the index patient after arrival (2,6 days). In four flights (19%), contacts were not identified or only after > 7 days. CI involving Dutch airlines was faster than non-Dutch airlines (P < 0,05). Passenger locator cards did not improve timeliness of CI. In only three flights contact details were identified within 2 days after arrival. CONCLUSION: CT for influenza A/H1N1 2009 among flight passengers was not successful for timely provision of prophylaxis. CT had little additional value for alerting passengers for disease symptoms, as this information already was provided during and after the flight.

Computational evaluation of anticipated PE_PGRS39 protein involvement in host–pathogen interplay and its integration into vaccine development,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year, which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen. Its success depends on its interaction with the host and its ability to regulate the host’s immune system for its own survival. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv (Mtb) proteome consists of unique PE_PGRS family proteins, which present a significant role in bacterial pathogenesis over the past years. Earlier evidence suggests that some PE_PGRS proteins display fibronectin-binding activity. In this manuscript, computational characterization of the PE_PGRS39 protein has indicated something peculiar about this protein. Investigation showed that PE_PGRS39 is an extracellular protein that, instead of acting as fibronectin-binding protein, might mimic fibronectin which binds to alpha-5 beta-1 (α5β1) integrin. PE_PGRS39 protein additionally turned into proven pieces of evidence to have motifs such as DXXG and GGXGXD and PXXP that bind with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), calcium, and host Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, respectively, in conjunction with RGD-integrin binding. These interactions designate the direct role of PE_PGRS39 in bacterial pathogenesis via cell adhesion and signaling. Additionally, the analysis showed that PE_PGRS39 is an antigenic protein and epitope prediction provided functional regions of the protein that trigger a cellular immune response facilitated by T or B cells. Further, an experimental analysis could also open up new avenues for developing novel drugs by targeting signaling motifs or novel vaccines using functional epitopes that could evoke an immune response in the host.",0,"Computational evaluation of anticipated PE_PGRS39 protein involvement in host–pathogen interplay and its integration into vaccine development Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year, which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen.

Investigation showed that PE_PGRS39 is an extracellular protein that, instead of acting as fibronectin-binding protein, might mimic fibronectin which binds to alpha-5 beta-1 (α5β1) integrin. PE_PGRS39 protein additionally turned into proven pieces of evidence to have motifs such as DXXG and GGXGXD and PXXP that bind with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), calcium, and host Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, respectively, in conjunction with RGD-integrin binding. These interactions designate the direct role of PE_PGRS39 in bacterial pathogenesis via cell adhesion and signaling. Additionally, the analysis showed that PE_PGRS39 is an antigenic protein and epitope prediction provided functional regions of the protein that trigger a cellular immune response facilitated by T or B cells. Further, an experimental analysis could also open up new avenues for developing novel drugs by targeting signaling motifs or novel vaccines using functional epitopes that could evoke an immune response in the host.",computational evaluation of anticipated pe_pgrs39 protein involvement in hostpathogen interplay and its integration into vaccine development mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen its success depends on its interaction with the host and its ability to regulate the hosts immune system for its own survival mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv mtb proteome consists of unique pe_pgrs family proteins which present a significant role in bacterial pathogenesis over the past years earlier evidence suggests that some pe_pgrs proteins display fibronectinbinding activity in this manuscript computational characterization of the pe_pgrs39 protein has indicated something peculiar about this protein investigation showed that pe_pgrs39 is an extracellular protein that instead of acting as fibronectinbinding protein might mimic fibronectin which binds to alpha5 beta1 α5β1 integrin pe_pgrs39 protein additionally turned into proven pieces of evidence to have motifs such as dxxg and ggxgxd and pxxp that bind with guanosine triphosphate gtp calcium and host src homology 3 sh3 domains respectively in conjunction with rgdintegrin binding these interactions designate the direct role of pe_pgrs39 in bacterial pathogenesis via cell adhesion and signaling additionally the analysis showed that pe_pgrs39 is an antigenic protein and epitope prediction provided functional regions of the protein that trigger a cellular immune response facilitated by t or b cells further an experimental analysis could also open up new avenues for developing novel drugs by targeting signaling motifs or novel vaccines using functional epitopes that could evoke an immune response in the host,1
Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila,"Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution. As a result, Drosophila can be used to deconstruct many of the key events in host-pathogen interactions by using a wealth of well-developed molecular and genetic tools. In this review, we aim to emphasize the great leverage provided by the suite of genomic and classical genetic approaches available in flies for decoding details of host-pathogen interactions; these findings can then be applied to studies in higher organisms. We first briefly summarize the general strategies by which Drosophila resists and responds to pathogens. We then focus on how recently developed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens conducted in cells and flies, combined with classical genetic methods, have provided molecular insight into host-pathogen interactions, covering examples of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Finally, we discuss novel strategies for how flies can be used as a tool to examine how specific isolated virulence factors act on an intact host.",0,"Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution.

Establishing the inter-rater reliability of spinal cord damage manual measurement using magnetic resonance imaging,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVES: To establish the inter-rater reliability in the quantitative evaluation of spinal cord damage following cervical incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used to perform manual measurements of the cranial and caudal boundaries of edema, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume in 10 participants with cervical incomplete SCI. SETTING: Academic university setting. METHODS: Structural MRIs of 10 participants with SCI were collected from Northwestern University’s Neuromuscular Imaging and Research Lab. All manual measures were performed using OsiriX (Pixmeo Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to determine inter-rater reliability across seven raters of varying experience. RESULTS: High-to-excellent inter-rater reliability was found for all measures. ICC values for cranial/caudal levels of involvement, edema length, midsagittal tissue bridge ratio, axial damage ratio, and edema volume were 0.99, 0.98, 0.90, 0.84, and 0.93, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Manual MRI measures of spinal cord damage are reliable between raters. Researchers and clinicians may confidently utilize manual MRI measures to quantify cord damage.

AIDS research and its role in China’s AIDS prevention and control policies,"By the end of 2005, the estimated number of HIV infected people in China was 650,000. The seriousness of the epidemic calls for effective control measures to tackle the problems in order to avoid the tragedy in Africa from happening in China. “Prevention First” is the cornerstone of the country’s health policy. On 2003 World AIDS Day, Premier Jiabao Wen announced a new national AIDS control policy, “Four Frees and One Care”. This policy clearly shows that the Chinese government has once again taken full responsibility to solve public health problems and has profound impact far beyond the AIDS field. In early 2006, the central government put scientific and technology innovation as a national priority and set the target to build an innovative China by year 2020. Since then, the government has been increasing investment in science and technology with major emphasis on both infectious diseases control and new drug research and development. For the first time, development of 100 new drugs and control of major infectious diseases (AIDS, HBV, TB and other emerging infectious diseases) have been selected as national key scientific projects. China’s best minds in related fields will be pooled to work together in order to remove the technical barriers blocking efficient control of the major infectious disease in China. Knowledge on molecular epidemiology, immunology, pathogenesis, HAART, as well as HIVDR strains will certainly provide urgently needed scientific information for China’s AIDS control program.

Two models of multiple sclerosis: Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection. A pathological and immunological comparison,"Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) are considered among the best models of human multiple sclerosis (MS). In both models, clinical disease is characterized by paralysis, while pathological changes consist of inflammatory demyelination. In both models there is a genetic influence on susceptibility/resistance to the development of disease. This has been thoroughly studied in TMEV infection, and it has been found to depend on both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non‐MHC genes. At least four genes have been so far identified. Because of this genetic influence, some strains of mice are more susceptible to both clinical and pathological changes than others, and susceptibility appears to best correlate with the ability of a certain murine strain to develop a delayed‐type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to viral antigens. We have also observed that even among mice which are equally susceptible clinically, striking differences may be seen under pathological examination. These consist of different gradients of severity of inflammation, particularly in regards to the macrophage component. There is an inverse relationship between the number of macrophages, and their length of stay in the CNS, and the ability of mice to remyelinate their lesions. The most severe lesions are in SJL/J mice, and remyelination in this strain is extremely poor. The least severe lesions in terms of macrophage invasion are in strains such as NZW and RIIIS/J, and these are able to remyelinate lesions very successfully. Murine chronic relapsing EAE (CR‐EAE) shows pathological changes in many ways similar to those in TMEV‐infected SJL/J mice, although less severe in terms of degrees of macrophage infiltration and tissue destruction. Mice with CR‐EAE have a correspondingly limited ability to remyelinate their lesions. In both models the pathology appears to be mediated through a DTH response. However, while in EAE the DTH response is clearly against neuroantigens, the response in TMEV infection is against the virus itself. The end result in both models would be that of myelin destruction through a lymphotoxincytokine‐mediated mechanism. The importance of the DTH response in both models is well illustrated by the effects of tolerance induction in EAE and TMEV infection to neuroantigens and virus, respectively. These are important models of human MS, since the current hypothesis is that a viral infection early in life, on the appropriate genetic background, may trigger a secondary misdirected immune response which could be directed either against myelin antigens and/or possible persistent virus(es). © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",0,"Two models of multiple sclerosis: Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection.

A Novel Virus Causes Scale Drop Disease in Lates calcarifer,"From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia. The most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales. It was referred to as scale drop syndrome, but the etiology remained enigmatic. By using a next-generation virus discovery technique, VIDISCA-454, sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish. The near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined, which shows a unique genome organization, and low levels of identity to known members of the Iridoviridae. Based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins, the virus is a novel member of the Megalocytivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. The virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture, where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected Asian seabass kidney and brain cells. Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm, characteristic for the Iridoviridae. In vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in Asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish. These findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome, as each of Koch’s postulates is fulfilled. We have named the virus Scale Drop Disease Virus. Vaccines prepared from BEI- and formalin inactivated virus, as well as from E. coli produced major capsid protein provide efficacious protection against scale drop disease.",0,"A Novel Virus Causes Scale Drop Disease in Lates calcarifer From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia.

Burden of Community-Acquired Pneumonia and Unmet Clinical Needs,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases and an important health problem, having considerable implications for healthcare systems worldwide. Despite important advances in prevention through vaccines, new rapid diagnostic tests and antibiotics, CAP management still has significant drawbacks. Mortality remains very high in severely ill patients presenting with respiratory failure or shock but is also high in the elderly. Even after a CAP episode, higher risk of death remains during a long period, a risk mainly driven by inflammation and patient-related co-morbidities. CAP microbiology has been altered by new molecular diagnostic tests that have turned viruses into the most identified pathogens, notwithstanding uncertainties about the specific role of each virus in CAP pathogenesis. Pneumococcal vaccines also impacted CAP etiology and thus had changed Streptococcus pneumoniae circulating serotypes. Pathogens from specific regions should also be kept in mind when treating CAP. New antibiotics for CAP treatment were not tested in severely ill patients and focused on multidrug-resistant pathogens that are unrelated to CAP, limiting their general use and indications for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Similarly, CAP management could be personalized through the use of adjunctive therapies that showed outcome improvements in particular patient groups. Although pneumococcal vaccination was only convincingly shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease, with a less significant effect in pneumococcal CAP, it remains the best therapeutic intervention to prevent bacterial CAP.

"Monitoring the Spatial Variation of Aerosol Optical Depth and Its Correlation with Land Use/Land Cover in Wuhan, China: A Perspective of Urban Planning","Aerosols significantly affect environmental conditions, air quality, and public health locally, regionally, and globally. Examining the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on aerosol optical depth (AOD) helps to understand how human activities influence air quality and develop suitable solutions. The Landsat 8 image and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products in summer in 2018 were used in LULC classification and AOD retrieval in this study. Spatial statistics and correlation analysis about the relationship between LULC and AOD were performed to examine the impact of LULC on AOD in summer in Wuhan, China. Results indicate that the AOD distribution expressed an obvious “basin effect” in urban development areas: higher AOD values concentrated in water bodies with lower terrain, which were surrounded by the high buildings or mountains with lower AOD values. The AOD values were negatively correlated with the vegetated areas while positively correlated to water bodies and construction lands. The impact of LULC on AOD varied with different contexts in all cases, showing a “context effect”. The regression correlations among the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and AOD in given landscape contexts were much stronger than those throughout the whole study area.

Assessment of Prescription Opioid Medical Use and Misuse Among Parents and Their Adolescent Offspring in the US,"IMPORTANCE: Limited information is available regarding the association between parental and adolescent medical prescription opioid use and misuse in the US. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between parental and adolescent prescription opioid medical use and misuse. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, nationally representative study included 15 200 parent-adolescent dyads from the annual 2015-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Data were collected from January 6, 2015, to December 20, 2017, and analyzed from October 4, 2019, to October 15, 2020. EXPOSURES: Parental past 12-month exclusive medical prescription opioid use and any misuse (ie, using without a prescription or in any way not directed by a physician). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adolescent past 12-month medical prescription opioid use or misuse. Multivariable regressions estimated associations between parental and offspring medical prescription opioid use or misuse, controlling for sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: Respondents included 9400 mother-child and 5800 father-child dyads in the same household; children were aged 12 to 17 years (52.8% male; mean [SD] age, 14.5 [1.7] years). Controlling for other factors, parental medical prescription opioid use was associated with adolescent prescription opioid medical use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53) and misuse (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25), whereas parental misuse was not. Parental medical prescription stimulant use was associated with adolescent medical prescription opioid use (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91). Parental marijuana use (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.13-2.99), parent-adolescent conflict (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.52), and adolescent depression (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.26-2.44) were associated with adolescent prescription opioid misuse. Adolescent delinquency (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.38-1.74) and perceived schoolmates’ drug use (aOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.95-4.23) were also associated with adolescent misuse and more weakly with medical use (aORs, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.22] and 1.61 [95% CI, 1.32-1.96], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Youth use of prescription opioids is in part a structural/environmental issue. The findings of this study suggest that parental medical prescription opioid use is associated with offspring prescription opioid use, whereas parental misuse is not. Restricting physicians’ opioid prescribing to parents is a crucial public health goal. In addition, parents could be educated on the risks of their prescription opioid use for offspring and on practices to mitigate risk, including safe medication storage and disposal.

Tollip or Not Tollip: What Are the Evolving Questions behind It?,"Tollip plays an important role in the interleukin-1 receptor IL-1R and Toll pathways. As a modulator of the immune pathway, it indirectly controls the amount of antimicrobial peptides. This could indicate a vital step in maintaining animal immune systems and preventing infection. Evolutionary questions are crucial to understanding the conservation and functioning of the biochemical pathways like the Tollip-mediated one. Through an analysis of 36 sequences of the Tollip protein from different animal taxa, downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databank, we inferred diverse evolutionary parameters, such as molecular selection and structure conservation, by analyzing residue by residue, beyond the canonical parameters to this type of study, as maximum likelihood trees. We found that Tollip presented different trends in its evolving history. In primates, the protein is becoming more unstable, just the opposite is observed in the arthropod group. The most interesting finding was the concentration of positively selected residues at amino terminal ends. Some observed topological incongruences in maximum likelihood trees of complete and curated Tollip data sets could be explained through horizontal transfers, evidenced by recombination detection. These results suggest that there is more to be researched and understood about this protein.",0,"Tollip or Not Tollip: What Are the Evolving Questions behind It?

Next-generation influenza vaccines: opportunities and challenges,"Seasonal influenza vaccines lack efficacy against drifted or pandemic influenza strains. Developing improved vaccines that elicit broader immunity remains a public health priority.

"The Forgotten Plague: Psychiatric Manifestations of Ebola, Zika, and Emerging Infectious Diseases","The media and public health generally focus on the biological and physical ramifications of epidemics. Mental health issues that coincide with emerging diseases and epidemics are rarely examined and sometimes, even eschewed due to cultural considerations. Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially with a focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness. Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection. Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness. Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations. Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented. While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or fiscal estimates solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations. Therefore, those on the frontlines of epidemics including emergency physicians, primary care providers and infectious disease specialists should serve communicate this need and advocate for sustained and increased funding for mental health programs to heighten public awareness regarding acute psychiatric events during infectious diseases outbreaks and offer treatment and support when necessary.",0,"The Forgotten Plague: Psychiatric Manifestations of Ebola, Zika, and Emerging Infectious Diseases The media and public health generally focus on the biological and physical ramifications of epidemics.

Long-term follow-up of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for refractory juvenile dermatomyositis: a case-series study,"OBJECTIVE: To follow up the refractory juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in a long time and to investigate whether AHSCT is effective and safe to treat refractory JDM. METHODS: We collected the AHSCT and follow-up data of three patients with refractory JDM who received autologous peripheral blood CD34+ cell transplantation in our hospital between June 2004 and July 2015. Those data include: hight, weight, routine blood and urine tests, ESR, CK, ALT, AST, LDH, renal functional tests, lymphocyte subpopulations, HRCT and muscle MRI. The last follow-up was done in June 2017. RESULTS: All three patients had complete remission and could stop prednisone after 3–12 months. None of them relapsed at 144, 113 and 23 months follow-up. Twelve months after their AHSCT, all of their monitoring indexes have returned to normal and they have stopped all medications. Until the date of this article, none of them relapsed or need medicine. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that AHSCT is safe and effective in treating refractory JDM, and it can provides long term drug-free survival.

Cross-subtype Immunity against Avian Influenza in Persons Recently Vaccinated for Influenza,"Avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be transmitted to humans, resulting in a severe or fatal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian influenza (H5N1) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal influenza A (H1N1)/(H3N2). A small frequency of CD4 T cells specific for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against influenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors. No correlation between influenza-specific CD4 T cells and humoral responses was observed. N1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity, but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point. These findings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 by seasonal influenza vaccination.",0,"Cross-subtype Immunity against Avian Influenza in Persons Recently Vaccinated for Influenza Avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be transmitted to humans, resulting in a severe or fatal disease.

The Relationship of CSF and Plasma Cytokine Levels in HIV Infected Patients with Neurocognitive Impairment,"Although HAD is now rare due to HAART, the milder forms of HAND persist in HIV-infected patients. HIV-induced systemic and localized inflammation is considered to be one of the mechanisms of HAND. The levels of cytokines in CSF were associated with neurocognitive impairment in HIV infection. However, the changes of cytokines involved in cognition impairment in plasma have not been shown, and their relationships between CSF and plasma require to be addressed. We compared cytokine levels in paired CSF and plasma samples from HIV-infected individuals with or without neurocognitive impairment. Cytokine concentrations were measured by Luminex xMAP. In comparing the expression levels of cytokines in plasma and CSF, IFN-α2, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 were significantly higher in CSF. Eotaxin was significantly higher in plasma, whereas G-CSF showed no difference between plasma and CSF. G-CSF (P = 0.0079), IL-8 (P = 0.0223), IP-10 (P = 0.0109), and MCP-1 (P = 0.0497) in CSF showed significant difference between HIV-CI and HIV-NC group, which may indicate their relationship to HIV associated neurocognitive impairment. In addition, G-CSF (P = 0.0191) and IP-10 (P = 0.0377) in plasma were significantly higher in HIV-CI than HIV-NC. The consistent changes of G-CSF and IP-10 in paired plasma and CSF samples might enhance their potential for predicting HAND.",0,"The Relationship of CSF and Plasma Cytokine Levels in HIV Infected Patients with Neurocognitive Impairment Although HAD is now rare due to HAART, the milder forms of HAND persist in HIV-infected patients.

However, the changes of cytokines involved in cognition impairment in plasma have not been shown, and their relationships between CSF and plasma require to be addressed. We compared cytokine levels in paired CSF and plasma samples from HIV-infected individuals with or without neurocognitive impairment. Cytokine concentrations were measured by Luminex xMAP. In comparing the expression levels of cytokines in plasma and CSF, IFN-α2, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 were significantly higher in CSF. Eotaxin was significantly higher in plasma, whereas G-CSF showed no difference between plasma and CSF. G-CSF (P = 0.0079), IL-8 (P = 0.0223), IP-10 (P = 0.0109), and MCP-1 (P = 0.0497) in CSF showed significant difference between HIV-CI and HIV-NC group, which may indicate their relationship to HIV associated neurocognitive impairment. In addition, G-CSF (P = 0.0191) and IP-10 (P = 0.0377) in plasma were significantly higher in HIV-CI than HIV-NC.

"Characterization of HIV-1 subtypes and drug resistance mutations in Henan Province, China (2017–2019)","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection remains a severe public health problem worldwide. In this study, we investigated the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among patients with HIV-1 infection in Henan Province, China. HIV-1 strains in blood samples taken from inpatients and outpatients visiting the Sixth People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou from August 2017 to July 2019 with a viral load (VL) greater than 1000 copies/ml were subjected to subtype and DRMs analysis. Out of a total of 769 samples, subtype and DRM data were obtained from 657 (85.43%) samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial pol gene sequences indicated that the most commonly found genotype was subtype B (45.51%, 299/657), followed by CRF01_AE (28.61%, 188/657), CRF07_BC (15.68%, 103/657), CRF08_BC (0.76%, 5/657), C (0.61%, 4/657), A (0.30%, 2/657), and others (8.52%, 56/657). Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were most commonly found in patients who were naïve to antiretroviral treatment (ART) (68.67%, 160/233). The percentage of patients with one or more major drug-resistance mutations was 50.99% (335/657), and it was 6.44% (15/233) in ART-naive patients that were primarily infected with subtype B (17.74%). Resistance mutations were most common at codons 65, 103, 106, 184, and 190 of the reverse transcriptase gene and codon 46 of the protease gene. Our study provides detailed information about the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the incidence of drug resistance mutations of different subtypes in ART-experienced and naïve patients. This can guide policymakers in making decisions about treatment strategies against HIV-1.",0,"Characterization of HIV-1 subtypes and drug resistance mutations in Henan Province, China (2017–2019) Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection remains a severe public health problem worldwide.

Pandemic simulation of antivirals + school closures: buying time until strain-specific vaccine is available,"A strain-specific vaccine is unlikely to be available in the early phases of a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic. It could be months and at the current production rate may not provide timely protection to the population. Intervention strategies that control the spread of infection will be necessary in this situation, such as the use of the US stockpile of antiviral medication coupled with a 6-month school closure. The agent-based simulation model, EpiSimS, was used to assess the impact of this intervention strategy followed by three different vaccine approaches: (1) 2-dose, 80% effective, (2) 1-dose, 30% effective, and (3) 1 dose, 80% effective. Simulations show that the combination of antivirals, school closures, and a strain-specific vaccine can reduce morbidity and mortality while in effect. A significant second infection wave can occur with current vaccine technology once school closures are relaxed, though an ideal vaccine is able to contain it. In our simulations, worker absenteeism increases in all cases mostly attributed to household adults staying home with children due to the school closures.",0,"Pandemic simulation of antivirals + school closures: buying time until strain-specific vaccine is available A strain-specific vaccine is unlikely to be available in the early phases of a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic.

"Preclinical evaluation of AT-527, a novel guanosine nucleotide prodrug with potent, pan-genotypic activity against hepatitis C virus","Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC(50) of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1–5, ranged from 5–28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1–5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 μM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC(50) values ≥25 μM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.",0,"Preclinical evaluation of AT-527, a novel guanosine nucleotide prodrug with potent, pan-genotypic activity against hepatitis C virus Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals.

Enterovirus Control of Translation and RNA Granule Stress Responses,"Enteroviruses such as poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) have evolved several parallel strategies to regulate cellular gene expression and stress responses to ensure efficient expression of the viral genome. Enteroviruses utilize their encoded proteinases to take over the cellular translation apparatus and direct ribosomes to viral mRNAs. In addition, viral proteinases are used to control and repress the two main types of cytoplasmic RNA granules, stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are stress-responsive dynamic structures involved in repression of gene expression. This review discusses these processes and the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms with respect to enterovirus infections.

452. Spectrum of Respiratory Pathogens Detected by Multiplex PCR in a Study of Respiratory Tract Infections Among Travelers,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are a significant cause of health problems, accounting for about 10% of consultations in returning travelers. Nevertheless, the precise microbial etiology is not identified in many cases. METHODS: Prospectively collected 63 respiratory specimens (sputum or throat swab) from patients presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, or abnormal findings of chest auscultation) after travel were tested using multiplex real-time PCR. The FTD Respiratory pathogens 33 (Fast-track diagnostics, Ltd.) can simultaneously detect 33 different respiratory pathogens directly from respiratory specimens. This test ran in the PCR-Only mode on BD MAX™ (Nippon Becton Dickinson Company, Ltd.) and LightCycler480 System (Roche). RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive cases were included in the study. Thirty-nine cases were diagnosed as non-specific upper respiratory tract infections, five cases were influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, threecases was acute sinusitis, and one case was acute pharyngitis, dengue fever. Twenty-four cases had returned from travel in Southeast Asia, nine from Africa, and 8 from Latin America, seven from South Asia, six from middle east, threefrom North America, threefrom East Asia, 2 from Oceania, and one from Europe. Of the 59 specimens analyzed, 48 (81.4%) tested positive for pathogens whereas 11 tested negative. Commonly detected pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (14 cases; 23.7%), influenza A (10 cases; 17.0%), rhinovirus (9 cases; 15.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (8 cases; 13.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8 cases; 13.6%), Streptococcus pneumonia, coronaviruses OC43, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4 cases; 6.8%, respectively). Multiple pathogens were detected in 30.5% of the specimens. In 14 cases (23.7%), both virus and bacteria were detected from one specimen. CONCLUSION: Not only viruses, bacterial pathogens were detected frequently than expected in the patients of RTI.

A Chimeric Sudan Virus-Like Particle Vaccine Candidate Produced by a Recombinant Baculovirus System Induces Specific Immune Responses in Mice and Horses,"Ebola virus infections lead to severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates; and human fatality rates are as high as 67%–90%. Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant or Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection. Further, these horse anti-SUDV purified immunoglobulins lay a foundation for SUDV therapeutic drug research.",0,"A Chimeric Sudan Virus-Like Particle Vaccine Candidate Produced by a Recombinant Baculovirus System Induces Specific Immune Responses in Mice and Horses Ebola virus infections lead to severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates; and human fatality rates are as high as 67%–90%.

"Rotavirus group A genotype circulation patterns across Kenya before and after nationwide vaccine introduction, 2010–2018","BACKGROUND: Kenya introduced the monovalent G1P [8] Rotarix® vaccine into the infant immunization schedule in July 2014. We examined trends in rotavirus group A (RVA) genotype distribution pre- (January 2010–June 2014) and post- (July 2014–December 2018) RVA vaccine introduction. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children aged < 13 years from four surveillance sites across Kenya: Kilifi County Hospital, Tabitha Clinic Nairobi, Lwak Mission Hospital, and Siaya County Referral Hospital (children aged < 5 years only). Samples were screened for RVA using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and VP7 and VP4 genes sequenced to infer genotypes. RESULTS: We genotyped 614 samples in pre-vaccine and 261 in post-vaccine introduction periods. During the pre-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent RVA genotypes were G1P [8] (45.8%), G8P [4] (15.8%), G9P [8] (13.2%), G2P [4] (7.0%) and G3P [6] (3.1%). In the post-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent genotypes were G1P [8] (52.1%), G2P [4] (20.7%) and G3P [8] (16.1%). Predominant genotypes varied by year and site in both pre and post-vaccine periods. Temporal genotype patterns showed an increase in prevalence of vaccine heterotypic genotypes, such as the commonly DS-1-like G2P [4] (7.0 to 20.7%, P < .001) and G3P [8] (1.3 to 16.1%, P < .001) genotypes in the post-vaccine introduction period. Additionally, we observed a decline in prevalence of genotypes G8P [4] (15.8 to 0.4%, P < .001) and G9P [8] (13.2 to 5.4%, P < .001) in the post-vaccine introduction period. Phylogenetic analysis of genotype G1P [8], revealed circulation of strains of lineages G1-I, G1-II and P [8]-1, P [8]-III and P [8]-IV. Considerable genetic diversity was observed between the pre and post-vaccine strains, evidenced by distinct clusters. CONCLUSION: Genotype prevalence varied from before to after vaccine introduction. Such observations emphasize the need for long-term surveillance to monitor vaccine impact. These changes may represent natural secular variation or possible immuno-epidemiological changes arising from the introduction of the vaccine.

Effect of dual-subtype vaccine against feline immunodeficiency virus infection,"Dual-subtype feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vaccine, consisting of inaactivated cells infected with subtypes A (Petaluma strain) and D (Shizuoka strain), was developed and tested for its vaccine efficacy against FIV infection in specific pathogen free (SPF) cats. Animals were monitored for proviral DNA by FIV-specific PCR and for FIV-specific antibody profiles by ELISA and virus-neutralization assays. In addition, blood from challenged cats was inoculated into naive SPF cats to confirm the viral status of the vaccinated cats. All cats immunized with Petaluma vaccine alone were protected against homologous Petaluma challenge, but only one of four cats was protected against heterologous Shizuoka challenge. More importantly, all cats immunized with the dual-subtype vaccine were protected against both Petaluma and Shizuoka challenges. These results suggest that a multi-subtype vaccine approach may provide the broad-spectrum immunity necessary for vaccine protection against strains from different subtypes.",0,"Effect of dual-subtype vaccine against feline immunodeficiency virus infection Dual-subtype feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vaccine, consisting of inaactivated cells infected with subtypes A (Petaluma strain) and D (Shizuoka strain), was developed and tested for its vaccine efficacy against FIV infection in specific pathogen free (SPF) cats.

Evaluation of immunoprotective effects of recombinant protein and DNA vaccine based on Eimeria tenella surface antigen 16 and 22 in vivo,"Coccidiosis triggered by Eimeria tenella is accompanied by haemorrhagic caecum and high morbidity. Vaccines are preferable choices to replace chemical drugs against coccidiosis. Surface antigens of apicomplexan parasites can adhere to host cells during the infection process. Therefore, truncated fragments coding E. tenella surface antigen 16 (EtSAG16) and 22 (EtSAG22) were cloned into pET-28a prokaryotic vector to express recombinant protein 16 (rEtSAG16) and 22 (rEtSAG22), respectively. Likewise, pEGFP-N1-EtSAG16 and pEGFP-N1-EtSAG22 plasmids were constructed using pEGFP-N1 eukaryotic vector. Further, pEGFP-N1-EtSAG4-16-22 multiple gene plasmid carrying EtSAG4, 16 and 22 were designed as cocktail vaccines to study integral immunoprotective effects. Western blot and RT-PCR (reverse transcription) assay were performed to verify expressions of EtSAG16 and 22 genes. Immunoprotective effects of recombinant protein or DNA vaccine were evaluated using different doses (50 or 100 μg) in vivo. All chickens in the vaccination group showed higher cytokine concentration (IFN-γ and IL-17), raised IgY antibody level, increased weight gain, lower caecum lesion score and reduced oocyst shedding compared with infection control groups (p < 0.05). The highest anticoccidial index (ACI) value 173.11 was from the pEGFP-N1-EtSAG4-16-22 plasmid (50 μg) group. In conclusion, EtSAG16 and 22 might be alternative candidate genes for generating vaccines against E. tenella infection.",0,"Evaluation of immunoprotective effects of recombinant protein and DNA vaccine based on Eimeria tenella surface antigen 16 and 22 in vivo Coccidiosis triggered by Eimeria tenella is accompanied by haemorrhagic caecum and high morbidity.

Surgical Timing and Outcomes of Unilateral Versus Bilateral Superior Cavopulmonary Anastomosis: An Analysis of Pediatric Heart Network Public Databases,"Requiring bilateral superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (bSCPA) instead of unilateral superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (uSCPA) could influence surgical timing and outcomes. We compared surgical timing and outcomes for patients who underwent uSCPA to those who underwent bSCPA through use of the Pediatric Heart Network’s public datasets for the Infant Single Ventricle trial and Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial. There was no statistically significant difference in median age at SCPA (158 vs. 150 days, p = 0.68), hospital length of stay (LOS) (7 vs. 7 days, p = 0.74), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (4 vs. 5 days, p = 0.53), time requiring ventilator support (2 vs. 2 days, p = 0.51), or oxygen saturation at discharge (82 vs. 81%, p = 0.22) between the uSCPA and bSCPA groups, respectively. However, sub-analysis comparing only those who underwent early SCPA, at < 120 days of age, revealed significantly longer hospital LOS (8 vs. 13 days, p = 0.04), ICU LOS (5 vs. 11 days, p = 0.01), and time requiring ventilator support (2 vs. 4 days, p = 0.03) for the early bSCPA group when compared to the early uSCPA group. A multivariable logistic regression revealed bSCPA to be the only significant predictor of prolonged hospital LOS for patients who underwent early SCPA (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.2–14.2). Overall, there was no difference in surgical timing or outcome measures between uSCPA and bSCPA. However, early bSCPA, performed at < 120 days, had worse outcome measures than early uSCPA.

Risk factors for severe acute lower respiratory infections in children – a systematic review and meta-analysis,"AIM: To identify the risk factors in children under five years of age for severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), which are the leading cause of child mortality. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published literature available in the public domain. We conducted a quality assessment of all eligible studies according to GRADE criteria and performed a meta-analysis to report the odds ratios for all risk factors identified in these studies. RESULTS: We identified 36 studies that investigated 19 risk factors for severe ALRI. Of these, 7 risk factors were significantly associated with severe ALRI in a consistent manner across studies, with the following meta-analysis estimates of odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals): low birth weight 3.18 (1.02-9.90), lack of exclusive breastfeeding 2.34 (1.42-3.88), crowding – more than 7 persons per household 1.96 (1.53-2.52), exposure to indoor air pollution 1.57 (1.06-2.31), incomplete immunization 1.83 (1.32-2.52), undernutrition – weight-for-age less than 2 standard deviations 4.47 (2.10-9.49), and HIV infection 4.15 (2.57-9.74). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the role of the above seven risk factors in the development of severe pneumonia in under-five children. In addition, it emphasizes the need for further studies investigating other potential risk factors. Since these risk factors are potentially preventable, health policies targeted at reducing their prevalence provide a basis for decreasing the burden of childhood pneumonia.",0,"Risk factors for severe acute lower respiratory infections in children – a systematic review and meta-analysis AIM: To identify the risk factors in children under five years of age for severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), which are the leading cause of child mortality.

Antigen-expressing immunostimulatory liposomes as a genetically programmable synthetic vaccine,"Liposomes are versatile (sub)micron-sized membrane vesicles that can be used for a variety of applications, including drug delivery and in vivo imaging but they also represent excellent models for artificial membranes or cells. Several studies have demonstrated that in vitro transcription and translation can take place inside liposomes to obtain compartmentalized production of functional proteins within the liposomes (Kita et al. in Chembiochem 9(15):2403–2410, 2008; Moritani et al.in FEBS J, 2010; Kuruma et al. in Methods Mol Biol 607:161–171, 2010; Murtas et al. in Biochem Biophys Res Commun 363(1):12–17, 2007; Sunami et al. in Anal Biochem 357(1):128–136, 2006; Ishikawa et al. in FEBS Lett 576(3):387–390, 2004; Oberholzer et al. in Biochem Biophys Res Commun 261(2):238–241, 1999). Such a minimal artificial cell-based model is ideal for synthetic biology based applications. In this study, we propose the use of liposomes as artificial microbes for vaccination. These artificial microbes can be genetically programmed to produce specific antigens at will. To show proof-of-concept for this artificial cell-based platform, a bacterial in vitro transcription and translation system together with a gene construct encoding the model antigen β-galactosidase were entrapped inside multilamellar liposomes. Vaccination studies in mice showed that such antigen-expressing immunostimulatory liposomes (AnExILs) elicited higher specific humoral immune responses against the produced antigen (β-galactosidase) than control vaccines (i.e. AnExILs without genetic input, liposomal β-galactosidase or pDNA encoding β-galactosidase).

Identification of an aprotinin antiviral domain,"Digestion of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin, by clostripain, a cysteine proteinase, yielded five oligopeptide fragments. Two fragments exhibited both antiviral and antibacterial activities, two fragments only antiviral activity, and one fragment showed no antimicrobial activity.

It consisted of the hexapeptide Y-F-Y-N-A-K corresponding to amino acids 21–26 of intact aprotinin. An identical synthetic peptide had the same antiviral spectrum as the natural hexapeptide, exhibited no antibacterial activity, and was also devoid of trypsin inhibiting activity.

Screening efficient siRNAs in vitro as the candidate genes for chicken anti-avian influenza virus H5N1 breeding,"The frequent disease outbreaks caused by avian influenza virus (AIV) not only affect the poultry industry but also pose a threat to human safety. To address the problem, RNA interference (RNAi) has recently been widely used as a potential antiviral approach. Transgenesis, in combination with RNAi to specifically inhibit AIV gene expression, has been proposed to make chickens resistant to avian influenza. For the transgenic breeding, screening the efficient siRNAs in vitro as the candidate genes is one of the most important tasks. Here, we combined an online search tool and a series of bioinformatics programs with a set of rules for designing the siRNAs targeting different mRNA regions of AIV H5N1 subtype. By this method we chose five rational siRNAs, constructed five U6 promoter-driven shRNA expression plasmids contained the siRNA genes, and used these to produce stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Data from virus titration, IFA, PUI-stained flow cytometry, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and DAS-ELISA analyses showed that all five stably transfected cell lines were effectively resistant to viral replication when exposed to 100 CCID50 of AIV, and we finally chose the most effective plasmids (pSi-604i and pSi-1597i) as the candidates for making the transgenic chickens.

Prolonging herd immunity to cholera via vaccination: Accounting for human mobility and waning vaccine effects,"BACKGROUND: Oral cholera vaccination is an approach to preventing outbreaks in at-risk settings and controlling cholera in endemic settings. However, vaccine-derived herd immunity may be short-lived due to interactions between human mobility and imperfect or waning vaccine efficacy. As the supply and utilization of oral cholera vaccines grows, critical questions related to herd immunity are emerging, including: who should be targeted; when should revaccination be performed; and why have cholera outbreaks occurred in recently vaccinated populations? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use mathematical models to simulate routine and mass oral cholera vaccination in populations with varying degrees of migration, transmission intensity, and vaccine coverage. We show that migration and waning vaccine efficacy strongly influence the duration of herd immunity while birth and death rates have relatively minimal impacts. As compared to either periodic mass vaccination or routine vaccination alone, a community could be protected longer by a blended “Mass and Maintain” strategy. We show that vaccination may be best targeted at populations with intermediate degrees of mobility as compared to communities with very high or very low population turnover. Using a case study of an internally displaced person camp in South Sudan which underwent high-coverage mass vaccination in 2014 and 2015, we show that waning vaccine direct effects and high population turnover rendered the camp over 80% susceptible at the time of the cholera outbreak beginning in October 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Oral cholera vaccines can be powerful tools for quickly protecting a population for a period of time that depends critically on vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy over time, and the rate of population turnover through human mobility. Due to waning herd immunity, epidemics in vaccinated communities are possible but become less likely through complementary interventions or data-driven revaccination strategies.",0,"Prolonging herd immunity to cholera via vaccination: Accounting for human mobility and waning vaccine effects BACKGROUND: Oral cholera vaccination is an approach to preventing outbreaks in at-risk settings and controlling cholera in endemic settings.

Understanding cellular interactions with nanomaterials: towards a rational design of medical nanodevices,"Biomedical applications increasingly require fully characterized new nanomaterials. There is strong evidence showing that nanomaterials not only interact with cells passively but also actively, mediating essential molecular processes for the regulation of cellular functions, but we are only starting to understand the mechanisms of those interactions. Systematic studies about cell behavior as a response to specific nanoparticle properties are scarce in the literature even when they are necessary for the rational design of medical nanodevices. Information in the literature shows that the physicochemical properties determine the bioactivity, biocompatibility, and safety of nanomaterials. The information available regarding the interaction and responses of cells to nanomaterials has not been analyzed and discussed in a single document. Hence, in this review, we present the latest advances about cellular responses to nanomaterials and integrate the available information into concrete considerations for the development of innovative, efficient, specific and, more importantly, safe biomedical nanodevices. We focus on how physicochemical nanoparticle properties (size, chemical surface, shape, charge, and topography) influence cell behavior in a first attempt to provide a practical guide for designing medical nanodevices, avoiding common experimental omissions that may lead to data misinterpretation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the systematic study of nano–bio interactions to acquire sufficient reproducible information that allows accurate control of cell behavior based on tuning of nanomaterial properties. This information is useful to guide the design of specific nanodevices and nanomaterials to elicit desired cell responses, like targeting, drug delivery, cell attachment, differentiation, etc, or to avoid undesired side effects.",0,"Understanding cellular interactions with nanomaterials: towards a rational design of medical nanodevices Biomedical applications increasingly require fully characterized new nanomaterials.

Impact of Timing of Diagnosis of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Disease on Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) in Adults: Final Analysis from a Retrospective Chart Review Study,"BACKGROUND: Despite growing clinical awareness of RSV disease in at-risk adult subpopulations, significant gaps remain in knowledge, especially around diagnosis. This analysis aimed to understand the impact of timing of diagnosis on hospital LOS. METHODS: A retrospective review of patient charts was conducted. Data for adults ≥18 years with confirmed RSV (Oct 2014–Oct 2016; USA) were collected. Each physician (n = 132) submitted up to 3 randomly selected patient cases via an online survey. RESULTS: This study comprised 379 patients, collected in 4 groups (Table). >80% of patients received an RT-PCR test; rapid antigen tests were uncommon (≤10%) with an RT-PCR test also performed in 45% of these. Early RSV diagnosis and less severe disease were associated with a shorter mean LOS (Figure 1and2). Patients diagnosed >24h post-admission had a longer mean [SD] LOS (9.8 [8.6] days; n = 29) than patients diagnosed <12h post-admission (6.2 [3.9] days; n = 67; P = 0.006), and patients diagnosed 12–24h post-admission (7.4 [4.2] days; n = 56; P = 0.038). LOS was higher (P = 0.005) in patients diagnosed in the intensive care unit (9.4 days) than the emergency room or hospital ward (both 6.8 days). CONCLUSION: RSV disease in adults was typically diagnosed by PCR. Delayed diagnosis and greater RSV disease severity are associated with longer LOS, but results need to be confirmed by prospective trials.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Induces PD-L1 Expression on Antigen-Presenting Cells via Autocrine and Paracrine Interleukin-STAT3 Circuits,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only licensed vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), and is also used as an immunotherapy for bladder cancer and other malignancies due to its immunostimulatory properties. Mycobacteria spp., however, are well known for their numerous immune evasion mechanisms that limit the true potential of their therapeutic use. One such major mechanism is the induction of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which mitigates adaptive immune responses. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular pathways behind PD-L1 up-regulation on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by BCG. We found that infection of APCs with BCG induced PD-L1 up-regulation, but that this did not depend on direct infection, suggesting a soluble mediator for this effect. BCG induced potent quantities of IL-6 and IL-10, and the downstream transcription factor STAT3 was hyper-phosphorylated. Intracellular analyses revealed that levels of PD-L1 molecules were associated with the STAT3 phosphorylation state, suggesting a causal link. Neutralisation of the IL-6 or IL-10 cytokine receptors dampened STAT3 phosphorylation and BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 on APCs. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 achieved the same effect, confirming an autocrine-paracrine cytokine loop as a mechanism for BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1. Finally, an in vivo immunisation model showed that BCG vaccination under PD-L1 blockade could enhance antigen-specific memory CD4 T-cell responses. These novel findings could lead to refinement of BCG as both a vaccine for infectious disease and as a cancer immunotherapy.",0,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Induces PD-L1 Expression on Antigen-Presenting Cells via Autocrine and Paracrine Interleukin-STAT3 Circuits Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only licensed vaccine for tuberculosis (TB), and is also used as an immunotherapy for bladder cancer and other malignancies due to its immunostimulatory properties.

Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus,"Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists. Canine distemper is a multi-host carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). The described cell receptor of CDV is SLAM (CD150). Attachment of CDV hemagglutinin protein (CDV-H) to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein (CDV-F). We investigated whether CDV strains co-evolved in the large, homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits, and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the SLAM binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from Canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families. Using an in vitro assay, we quantified syncytia formation mediated by CDV-H proteins from dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing dog, lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog SLAM than with cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types, but lower values in cells expressing dog SLAM than the values obtained for CDV-H proteins from dog strains. By experimentally changing one amino acid (Y549H) in the CDV-H protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits, thereby confirming its functional importance. A virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog SLAM than cells expressing SLAM of non-dog hosts, which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry. We provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by CDV strains, and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy. These findings extend knowledge on CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.",0,"Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists.

Using an in vitro assay, we quantified syncytia formation mediated by CDV-H proteins from dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing dog, lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog SLAM than with cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types, but lower values in cells expressing dog SLAM than the values obtained for CDV-H proteins from dog strains. By experimentally changing one amino acid (Y549H) in the CDV-H protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits, thereby confirming its functional importance. A virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog SLAM than cells expressing SLAM of non-dog hosts, which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry. We provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by CDV strains, and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy. These findings extend knowledge on CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.",antagonistic pleiotropy and fitness tradeoffs reveal specialist and generalist traits in strains of canine distemper virus theoretically homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists canine distemper is a multihost carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus cdv the described cell receptor of cdv is slam cd150 attachment of cdv hemagglutinin protein cdvh to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein cdvf we investigated whether cdv strains coevolved in the large homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits comparison of amino acid sequences of the slam binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families using an in vitro assay we quantified syncytia formation mediated by cdvh proteins from dog and nondog cdv strains in cells expressing dog lion or cat slam cdvh proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog slam than with cells expressing lion or cat slam cdvh proteins from strains of nondog species produced similar values in all three cell types but lower values in cells expressing dog slam than the values obtained for cdvh proteins from dog strains by experimentally changing one amino acid y549h in the cdvh protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits thereby confirming its functional importance a virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog slam than cells expressing slam of nondog hosts which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization postcell entry we provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by cdv strains and fitness tradeoffs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy these findings extend knowledge on cdv molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores,1
An unique CD4(+)CD8(+) intestinal intraepithelial Lymphocyte Specific for DnaK (Escherichia coli HSP70) may be selected by intestinal microflora of rats,"We have previously shown an age-associated increase in unique CD4+CD8+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (i-IEL) in rats. To elucidate the potential causes of the increase in CD4+CD8+ i-IEL with age, we analyzed the specificity of the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL and influence of intestinal microflora on the increase in this subset in aged rats. The purified CD4+CD8+ i-IEL proliferated in response to DnaK [Escherichia colt (E. coli) HSP70] in the presence of mitomycin-c (MMC)-treated syngeneic, spleen cells. The proportion of CD4+CD8+ T cells in whole i-IEL were significantly increased in aged rats fed commercial (CL-2) diet but not in those fed home-made (purified) diet under conventional condition. No CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were detected in aged rats under germfree condition, irrespective of diet feeding. A larger number of Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli, were detected in the intestinal contents and feces from aged rats with CD4+CD8+ i-IEL compared with those from aged rats fed without CD4+CD8+ i-IEL.

Online adaptive radiotherapy compared to plan selection for rectal cancer: quantifying the benefit,"BACKGROUND: To compare online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy (PS) with respect to dose to the organs at risk (OAR) for rectal cancer. METHODS: The first 20 patients treated with PS between May–September 2016 were included. This resulted in 10 short (SCRT) and 10 long (LCRT) course radiotherapy treatment schedules with a total of 300 Conebeam CT scans (CBCT). New dual arc VMAT plans were generated using auto-planning for both the online ART and PS strategy. For each fraction bowel bag, bladder and mesorectum were delineated on daily Conebeam CTs. The dose distribution planned was used to calculate daily DVHs. Coverage of the CTV was calculated, as defined by the dose received by 99% of the CTV volume (D99%). The volume of normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed fraction dose was calculated by calculating the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed fraction or more dose minus the volume of the CTV. For each fraction the difference between the plan selection and online adaptive strategy of each DVH parameter was calculated, as well as the average difference per patient. RESULTS: Target coverage remained the same for online ART. The median volume of the normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed dose dropped from 642 cm3 (PS) to 237 cm3 (online-ART)(p < 0.001). Online ART reduced dose to the OARs for all tested dose levels for SCRT and LCRT (p < 0.001). For V15Gy of the bowel bag the median difference over all fractions of all patients was − 126 cm(3) in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 206 cm(3) to − 40 cm(3). For SCRT the median difference was − 62 cm(3), while the range of the average difference per patient was − 105 cm3 to − 51 cm(3). For V15Gy of the bladder the median difference over all fractions of all patients was 26% in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 34 to 12%. For SCRT the median difference of V95% was − 8%, while the range of the average difference per patient was − 29 to 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Online ART for rectal cancer reduces dose the OARs significantly compared to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy, without compromising target coverage.

Combining ambitious climate policies with efforts to eradicate poverty,"Climate change threatens to undermine efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. However, climate policies could impose a financial burden on the global poor through increased energy and food prices. Here, we project poverty rates until 2050 and assess how they are influenced by mitigation policies consistent with the 1.5 °C target. A continuation of historical trends will leave 350 million people globally in extreme poverty by 2030. Without progressive redistribution, climate policies would push an additional 50 million people into poverty. However, redistributing the national carbon pricing revenues domestically as an equal-per-capita climate dividend compensates this policy side effect, even leading to a small net reduction of the global poverty headcount (−6 million). An additional international climate finance scheme enables a substantial poverty reduction globally and also in Sub-Saharan Africa. Combining national redistribution with international climate finance thus provides an important entry point to climate policy in developing countries.",0,"Combining ambitious climate policies with efforts to eradicate poverty Climate change threatens to undermine efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

The use of eHealth interventions among persons experiencing homelessness: A systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: eHealth interventions are being developed to meet the needs of diverse populations. Despite these advancements, little is known about how these interventions are used to improve the health of persons experiencing homelessness. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and experience of eHealth interventions for the homeless population. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted along with forward and backward citation searching to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: Eight articles met eligibility criteria. All articles were pilot or feasibility studies that used modalities, including short message service, mobile apps, computers, email, and websites, to deliver the interventions. The accessibility, flexibility, and convenience of the interventions were valued by participants. However, phone retention, limited adaptability, a high level of human involvement, and preference for in-person communication may pose future implementation challenges. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions are promising digital tools that have the potential to improve access to care and service delivery. eHealth interventions are feasible and usable for persons experiencing homelessness. These interventions may have health benefits by augmenting existing services and if implementation challenges are addressed. Further evaluation of the effectiveness of eHealth interventions is needed before widespread implementation. Those with lived experience should also be engaged in developing and evaluating these interventions.",0,"The use of eHealth interventions among persons experiencing homelessness: A systematic review OBJECTIVE: eHealth interventions are being developed to meet the needs of diverse populations.

Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins through Dynamic Interactions,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are over-represented in major disease pathways and have attracted significant interest in understanding if and how they may be targeted using small molecules for therapeutic purposes. While most existing studies have focused on extending the traditional structure-centric drug design strategies and emphasized exploring pre-existing structure features of IDPs for specific binding, several examples have also emerged to suggest that small molecules could achieve specificity in binding IDPs and affect their function through dynamic and transient interactions. These dynamic interactions can modulate the disordered conformational ensemble and often lead to modest compaction to shield functionally important interaction sites. Much work remains to be done on further elucidation of the molecular basis of the dynamic small molecule–IDP interaction and determining how it can be exploited for targeting IDPs in practice. These efforts will rely critically on an integrated experimental and computational framework for disordered protein ensemble characterization. In particular, exciting advances have been made in recent years in enhanced sampling techniques, Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-computing, and protein force field optimization, which have now allowed rigorous physics-based atomistic simulations to generate reliable structure ensembles for nontrivial IDPs of modest sizes. Such de novo atomistic simulations will play crucial roles in exploring the exciting opportunity of targeting IDPs through dynamic interactions.",0,"Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins through Dynamic Interactions Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are over-represented in major disease pathways and have attracted significant interest in understanding if and how they may be targeted using small molecules for therapeutic purposes.
