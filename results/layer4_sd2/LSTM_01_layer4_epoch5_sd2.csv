Jackknife and Bootstrap Tests of the Composition Vector Trees,"Composition vector trees (CVTrees) are inferred from whole-genome data by an alignment-free and parameter-free method. The agreement of these trees with the corresponding taxonomy provides an objective justification of the inferred phylogeny. In this work, we show the stability and self-consistency of CVTrees by performing bootstrap and jackknife re-sampling tests adapted to this alignment-free approach. Our ultimate goal is to advocate the viewpoint that time-consuming statistical re-sampling tests can be avoided at all in using this alignment-free approach. Agreement with taxonomy should be taken as a major criterion to estimate prokaryotic phylogenetic trees.",0,"Jackknife and Bootstrap Tests of the Composition Vector Trees Composition vector trees (CVTrees) are inferred from whole-genome data by an alignment-free and parameter-free method.

Flux sampling is a powerful tool to study metabolism under changing environmental conditions,"The development of high-throughput ‘omic techniques has sparked a rising interest in genome-scale metabolic models, with applications ranging from disease diagnostics to crop adaptation. Efficient and accurate methods are required to analyze large metabolic networks. Flux sampling can be used to explore the feasible flux solutions in metabolic networks by generating probability distributions of steady-state reaction fluxes. Unlike other methods, flux sampling can be used without assuming a particular cellular objective. We have undertaken a rigorous comparison of several sampling algorithms and concluded that the coordinate hit-and-run with rounding (CHRR) algorithm is the most efficient based on both run-time and multiple convergence diagnostics. We demonstrate the power of CHRR by using it to study the metabolic changes that underlie photosynthetic acclimation to cold of Arabidopsis thaliana plant leaves. In combination with experimental measurements, we show how the regulated interplay between diurnal starch and organic acid accumulation defines the plant acclimation process. We confirm fumarate accumulation as a requirement for cold acclimation and further predict γ–aminobutyric acid to have a key role in metabolic signaling under cold conditions. These results demonstrate how flux sampling can be used to analyze the feasible flux solutions across changing environmental conditions, whereas eliminating the need to make assumptions which introduce observer bias.",0,"Flux sampling is a powerful tool to study metabolism under changing environmental conditions The development of high-throughput ‘omic techniques has sparked a rising interest in genome-scale metabolic models, with applications ranging from disease diagnostics to crop adaptation.

"No implant, no solution, lost cases to surgery: orthopedic trauma triage for surgery in an NGO hospital in Sierra Leone","INTRODUCTION: In low-income countries (LIC), international surgeons face the fact that there are patients they cannot treat. The goal of this study was to identify and analyze patients lost to treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the data of 282 trauma victims from a non-governmental organizational (NGO) hospital in Sierra Leone, Africa. During a 3-month period (10.10.2015–08.01.2016), these patients had 367 injuries and underwent 263 orthopedic surgeries. Despite a clear indication, some patients did not receive surgical treatment. We identified these injuries and the reason why they could not be operated. The anatomic region of the injury was evaluated and if they had a bone or soft tissue defect or were infected. RESULTS: We identified 95 (25.89%) injuries in 70 patients (47 males; 23 females) that were not be operated. The reasons were lack of specific implants (no implant group; N = 33), no treatment strategy for the injury (no solution group; N = 29), and patients that were lost (lost patient group; N = 33), almost equally distributed by 1/3. In the no implant group were mainly closed fractures and fractures of the pelvis and the proximal femur. The implants needed were locking plates (N = 19), proximal femoral nails (N = 8), and implants for pelvic surgery (N = 6). In the no solution group were nearly all bone (P < 0.0000), soft tissue defects (P < 0.00001) and infections (P = 0.00003) compared to the rest and more open fractures (P < 0.00001). In the lost patients group, most fractures were closed (24 out of 33, P = 0.033). These fractures were mostly not urgent and were postponed repeatedly. CONCLUSION: One quarter of the patients did not receive the surgical treatment needed. Besides acquisition of implants, surgical skills and expertise could be a solution for this issue.

Genomic investigation of piglet resilience following porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes malabsorptive watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes in pigs. Since the 1970s, PED outbreaks have become a source of problems in pig producing countries all over the world, causing large economic losses for pig producers. Although the infection in adults is not fatal, in naïve suckling piglets mortality is close to 100%. In this study, we investigated genome‐wide differences between dead and recovered suckling piglets from commercial farms after PED outbreaks. Samples from 262 animals (156 dead and 106 recovered) belonging to several commercial lines were collected from five different farms in three different countries (USA, Canada and Germany) and genotyped with the porcine 80K SNP chip. Mean F (st) value was calculated in 1‐Mb non‐overlapping windows between dead and recovered individuals, and the results were normalized to find differences within the comparison. Seven windows with high divergence between dead and recovered were detected—five on chromosome 2, one on chromosome 4 and one on chromosome 15—in total encompassing 152 genes. Several of these genes are either under‐ or overexpressed in many virus infections, including Coronaviridae (such as SARS‐CoV). A total of 32 genes are included in one or more Gene Ontology terms that can be related to PED development, such as Golgi apparatus, as well as mechanisms generally linked to resilience or diarrhea development (cell proliferation, ion transport, ATPase activity). Taken together this information provides a first genomic picture of PEDV resilience in suckling piglets.",0,"Genomic investigation of piglet resilience following porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes malabsorptive watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes in pigs.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for pulmonary parenchymal disease in older children,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the support of children outside the newborn period who have pulmonary failure is only recently becoming accepted. It is again being applied, after earlier failures, because well-trained teams and improved equipment and techniques are available following the success of neonatal ECMO. In addition, in Europe extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) in adults has been more successful. The use of ECMO for pulmonary failure in children does not have fixed indications and has had considerably less success than neonatal ECMO. Patients who require inspired oxygen fractions of over 0.5 and positive end-expiratory pressures of over 6 cm H(2)O for more than 12 h after being treated for more than 48 h should be considered candidates, given the high mortality of children with ARDS (70%). Survival averages 50% to 60%. Circuits and patient management techniques are very similar to those for newborn ECMO, but patients usually require longer times on ECMO. There are many more options for cannulation for both venoarterial and venovenous techniques than in neonatal and cardiac ECMO. The improving results indicate that ECMO will play a part in treating children with pulmonary failure. Further studies will be required to determine which patients can benefit from ECMO as well as the exact application in each case.",0,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for pulmonary parenchymal disease in older children Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the support of children outside the newborn period who have pulmonary failure is only recently becoming accepted.

Score to identify the severity of adult patients with influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection at hospital admission,"The objective of this paper was to develop a prognostic index for severe complications among hospitalized patients with influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 618 inpatients with 2009 H1N1 virus infection admitted to 36 Spanish hospitals between July 2009 and February 2010. Risk factors evaluated included host-related factors and clinical data at admission. We developed a composite index of severe in-hospital complications (SIHC), which included: mortality, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and requirement for resuscitation maneuvers. Six factors were independently associated with SIHC: age >45 years, male sex, number of comorbidities, pneumonia, dyspnea, and confusion. From the β parameter obtained in the multivariate model, a weight was assigned to each factor to compute the individual influenza risk score. The score shows an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77. The SIHC rate was 1.9 % in the low-risk group, 10.3 % in the intermediate-risk group, and 29.6 % in the high-risk group. The odds ratio for complications was 21.8 for the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group.

DMAb inoculation of synthetic cross reactive antibodies protects against lethal influenza A and B infections,"Influenza virus remains a significant public health threat despite innovative vaccines and antiviral drugs. A major limitation to current vaccinations and therapies against influenza virus is pathogenic diversity generated by shift and drift. A simple, cost-effective passive immunization strategy via in vivo production of cross-protective antibody molecules may augment existing vaccines and antiviral drugs in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. We engineered synthetic plasmid DNA to encode two novel and broadly cross-protective monoclonal antibodies targeting influenza A and B. We utilized enhanced in vivo delivery of these plasmid DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) constructs and show that this strategy induces robust levels of functional antibodies directed against influenza A and B viruses in mouse sera. Mice receiving a single inoculation with anti-influenza A DMAb survive lethal Group 1 H1 and Group 2 H3 influenza A challenges, while inoculation with anti-influenza B DMAb yields protection against lethal Victoria and Yamagata lineage influenza B morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, these two DMAbs can be delivered coordinately resulting in exceptionally broad protection against both influenza A and B. We demonstrate this protection is similar to that achieved by conventional protein antibody delivery.

Development of Monoclonal Antibodies and Antigen-Capture ELISA for Human Parechovirus Type 3,"Human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) is an etiologic agent of respiratory diseases, meningitis, and sepsis-like illness in both infants and adults. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be a promising diagnostic tool for antigenic diseases such as virus infection, as they offer a high specificity toward a specific viral antigen. However, to date, there is no specific mAb available for the diagnosis of HPeV3 infection. In this study, we developed and characterized mAbs specific for HPeV3 capsid protein VP0. We used cell-free, wheat germ-synthesized viral VP0 protein for immunizing BALB/c mice to generate hybridomas. From the resultant hybridoma clones, we selected nine clones producing mAbs reactive to the HPeV3-VP0 antigen, based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Epitope mapping showed that these mAbs recognized three distinct domains in HPeV3 VP0. Six mAbs recognized HPeV3 specifically and the other three mAbs showed cross-reactivity with other HPeVs. Using the HPeV3-specific mAbs, we then developed an ELISA for viral antigen detection that could be reliably used for laboratory diagnosis of HPeV3. This ELISA system exhibited no cross-reactivity with other related viruses. Our newly developed mAbs would, thus, provide a useful set of tools for future research and ensure HPeV3-specific diagnosis.",0,"Development of Monoclonal Antibodies and Antigen-Capture ELISA for Human Parechovirus Type 3 Human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) is an etiologic agent of respiratory diseases, meningitis, and sepsis-like illness in both infants and adults.

"Indigenous Community Perspectives of Food Security, Sustainable Food Systems and Strategies to Enhance Access to Local and Traditional Healthy Food for Partnering Williams Treaties First Nations (Ontario, Canada)","In partnership with communities of the Williams Treaties First Nations in southern Ontario (Canada), we describe an approach to work with communities, and highlight perspectives of food security and sustainability, including priorities and opportunities to revitalize local food systems as a pathway to food security and food sovereignty. The objectives of our project were: (1) to build a shared understanding of food security and sustainability; and (2) to document community priorities, challenges and opportunities to enhance local food access. Utilizing an Indigenous methodology, the conversational method, within the framework of community-based participatory research, formative work undertaken helped to conceptualize food security and sustainability from a community perspective and solidify interests within the four participating communities to inform community-led action planning. Knowledge generated from our project will inform development of initiatives, programs or projects that promote sustainable food systems. The community-based actions identified support a path towards holistic wellbeing and, ultimately, Indigenous peoples’ right to food security and food sovereignty.",0,"Indigenous Community Perspectives of Food Security, Sustainable Food Systems and Strategies to Enhance Access to Local and Traditional Healthy Food for Partnering Williams Treaties First Nations (Ontario, Canada) In partnership with communities of the Williams Treaties First Nations in southern Ontario (Canada), we describe an approach to work with communities, and highlight perspectives of food security and sustainability, including priorities and opportunities to revitalize local food systems as a pathway to food security and food sovereignty.

Postnatal steroid management in preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly affecting extremely preterm infants. Although mechanical ventilation and oxygen requirements in premature infants are identified as inciting mechanisms for inflammation and the development of BPD over time, data now support an array of perinatal events that may stimulate the inflammatory cascade prior to delivery. Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, have proven beneficial for the prevention and management of BPD postnatally due to their anti-inflammatory characteristics. This review aims to examine the pharmacologic properties of several corticosteroids, appraise the existing evidence for postnatal corticosteroid use in preterm infants, and assess steroid management strategies to ameliorate BPD. Finally, we aim to provide guidance based on clinical experience for managing adrenal suppression resulting from prolonged steroid exposure since this is an area less well-studied.",0,"Postnatal steroid management in preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease commonly affecting extremely preterm infants.

Innate immune activation as a broad-spectrum biodefense strategy: Prospects and research challenges,"Biodefense strategies require protection against a broad and largely unforeseen spectrum of pathogens—the forte of innate immune system defenses—that have evolved over millennia to function within moments of encountering either ancient or newly emerging pathogens. Although constitutive, the innate immune system is activated by the presence of microbes or their products, providing a rationale for a potential biodefense strategy. Both prophylactic and postexposure strategies involving innate immune stimulation have been shown to be plausible to prevent or ameliorate infections in animal models. Innate immune-activating compounds based on conserved microbial components recognized by toll-like molecules and other receptors could be synthesized and delivered like drugs by using an entirely different strategy from conventional vaccination. However, important theoretic and practical questions emerge about developing and deploying innate immune protective strategies for biodefense. This rostrum discusses prospects and problems in the overall approach itself. Important topics include microbe-specific issues about innate immune system effectiveness against highly virulent pathogens and general questions, such as whether innate immune responses will be safe and effective if used in a diverse human population of different age groups and with different genetic makeups.",0,"Innate immune activation as a broad-spectrum biodefense strategy: Prospects and research challenges Biodefense strategies require protection against a broad and largely unforeseen spectrum of pathogens—the forte of innate immune system defenses—that have evolved over millennia to function within moments of encountering either ancient or newly emerging pathogens.

Preparing for Ebola Virus Disease in West African countries not yet affected: perspectives from Ghanaian health professionals,"BACKGROUND: The current Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic has ravaged the social fabric of three West African countries and affected people worldwide. We report key themes from an agenda-setting, multi-disciplinary roundtable convened to examine experiences and implications for health systems in Ghana, a nation without cases but where risk for spread is high and the economic, social and political impact of the impending threat is already felt. DISCUSSION: Participants’ personal stories and the broader debates to define fundamental issues and opportunities for preparedness focused on three inter-related themes. First, the dangers of the fear response itself were highlighted as a threat to the integrity and continuity of quality care. Second, healthcare workers’ fears were compounded by a demonstrable lack of societal and personal protections for infection prevention and control in communities and healthcare facilities, as evidenced by an ongoing cholera epidemic affecting over 20,000 patients in the capital Accra alone since June 2014. Third, a lack of coherent messaging and direction from leadership seems to have limited coordination and reinforced a level of mistrust in the government’s ability and commitment to mobilize an adequate response. Initial recommendations include urgent investment in the needed supplies and infrastructure for basic, routine infection control in communities and healthcare facilities, provision of assurances with securities for frontline healthcare workers, establishment of a multi-sector, “all-hazards” outbreak surveillance system, and engaging directly with key community groups to co-produce contextually relevant educational messages that will help decrease stigma, fear, and the demoralizing perception that the disease defies remedy or control. SUMMARY: The EVD epidemic provides an unprecedented opportunity for West African countries not yet affected by EVD cases to make progress on tackling long-standing health systems weaknesses. This roundtable discussion emphasized the urgent need to strengthen capacity for infection control, occupational health and safety, and leadership coordination. Significant commitment is needed to raise standards of hygiene in communities and health facilities, build mechanisms for collaboration across sectors, and engage community stakeholders in creating the needed solutions. It would be both devastating and irresponsible to waste the opportunity.",0,"Preparing for Ebola Virus Disease in West African countries not yet affected: perspectives from Ghanaian health professionals BACKGROUND: The current Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic has ravaged the social fabric of three West African countries and affected people worldwide.

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Risk for Frontline Health Care Workers,"To determine whether frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at greater risk for contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 than nonclinical staff, we conducted a study of 231 HCWs and 215 controls. Overall, 79 (17.7%) of 446 had a positive antibody titer by hemagglutination inhibition, with 46 (19.9%) of 231 HCWs and 33 (15.3%) of 215 controls positive (OR 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.84–2.22). Of 87 participants who provided a second serum sample, 1 showed a 4-fold rise in antibody titer; of 45 patients who had a nose swab sample taken during a respiratory illness, 7 had positive results. Higher numbers of children in a participant’s family and working in an intensive care unit were risk factors for infection; increasing age, working at hospital 2, and wearing gloves were protective factors. This highly exposed group of frontline HCWs was no more likely to contract pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza infection than nonclinical staff, which suggests that personal protective measures were adequate in preventing transmission.",0,"Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Risk for Frontline Health Care Workers To determine whether frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at greater risk for contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 than nonclinical staff, we conducted a study of 231 HCWs and 215 controls.

Use of social media in food safety in Saudi Arabia—a preliminary study,"Over the past two decades, the rapid rise of social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information online. Social media platforms are not now only used extensively by individuals but also by businesses, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and many other organizations to deliver information to the public and, in return, collect information from that same audience. The preliminary study presented here offers valuable insights into how social media may be used to improve food safety standards. Today, food safety is still a major health challenge in the country, which occasionally faces unsafe food supply chains, an increased number of food borne outbreaks, and poor hygiene education. Social media may be used as a very valuable tool for people to access important information and more knowledge about food safety. The limited-scope survey presented here was conducted over the western part of Saudi Arabia and included 295 individuals of both genders, among various age groups. Participants responded to an online questionnaire about their use of social media to obtain information about food safety. Results showed that social media was indeed a major outlet for individuals to access information on food safety, with the top-ranked social media platforms being WhatsApp (M = 2.99) followed by Snapchat (M = 3.72), YouTube (M = 4.08), Instagram (M = 4.46), and Facebook (M = 4.81). Additionally, we found that the most trusted sources of information was the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (72.6%) and the Saudi Ministry of Health (55.4%). Participants most frequently sought epidemiological information (52.5%), quantitative risk estimates (23.1%), and information on the various types of foodborne infections (15.3%); they preferred the information to be in video format (67.5%), articles (57.6%), infographics (55.3%).

Dietary Patterns Derived from UK Supermarket Transaction Data with Nutrient and Socioeconomic Profiles,"Poor diet is a leading cause of death in the United Kingdom (UK) and around the world. Methods to collect quality dietary information at scale for population research are time consuming, expensive and biased. Novel data sources offer potential to overcome these challenges and better understand population dietary patterns. In this research we will use 12 months of supermarket sales transaction data, from 2016, for primary shoppers residing in the Yorkshire and Humber region of the UK (n = 299,260), to identify dietary patterns and profile these according to their nutrient composition and the sociodemographic characteristics of the consumer purchasing with these patterns. Results identified seven dietary purchase patterns that we named: Fruity; Meat alternatives; Carnivores; Hydrators; Afternoon tea; Beer and wine lovers; and Sweet tooth. On average the daily energy intake of loyalty card holders -who may buy as an individual or for a household- is less than the adult reference intake, but this varies according to dietary purchase pattern. In general loyalty card holders meet the recommended salt intake, do not purchase enough carbohydrates, and purchase too much fat and protein, but not enough fibre. The dietary purchase pattern containing the highest amount of fibre (as an indicator of healthiness) is bought by the least deprived customers and the pattern with lowest fibre by the most deprived.

Association of Infectious Disease Physician Approval of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter With Appropriateness and Complications,"IMPORTANCE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are frequently used to deliver intravenous antimicrobial therapy. However, inappropriate PICC use may lead to patient harm. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of 21 653 PICCs placed for a primary indication of intravenous antimicrobial therapy between January 1, 2015, and July 26, 2019, was conducted in 42 hospitals participating in a quality collaborative across Michigan among hospitalized medical patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Appropriateness of PICCs was defined according to the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters as a composite measure of (1) single-lumen catheter use, (2) avoiding use of PICCs for 5 days or less, and (3) avoiding use of PICCs for patients with chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Complications related to PICCs included catheter occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, and central line–associated bloodstream infection. The association between infectious disease physician approval, device appropriateness, and catheter complications was assessed using multivariable models, adjusted for patient comorbidities and hospital clustering. Results were expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 21 653 PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobials (11 960 PICCs were placed in men [55.2%]; median age, 64.5 years [interquartile range, 53.4-75.4 years]); 10 238 PICCs (47.3%) were approved by an infectious disease physician prior to placement. Compared with PICCs with no documented approval, PICCs with approval by an infectious disease physician were more likely to be appropriately used (72.7% [7446 of 10 238] appropriate with approval vs 45.4% [5180 of 11 415] appropriate without approval; odds ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.29-3.79; P < .001). Furthermore, approval was associated with lower odds of a PICC-related complication (6.5% [665 of 10 238] with approval vs 11.3% [1292 of 11 415] without approval; odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.50-0.61). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that, when PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobial therapy, infectious disease physician approval of PICC insertion was associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications.

Compared with PICCs with no documented approval, PICCs with approval by an infectious disease physician were more likely to be appropriately used (72.7% [7446 of 10 238] appropriate with approval vs 45.4% [5180 of 11 415] appropriate without approval; odds ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.29-3.79; P < .001). Furthermore, approval was associated with lower odds of a PICC-related complication (6.5% [665 of 10 238] with approval vs 11.3% [1292 of 11 415] without approval; odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.50-0.61). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that, when PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobial therapy, infectious disease physician approval of PICC insertion was associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications.

Leptospirosis as an important differential of pulmonary haemorrhage on the intensive care unit: a case managed with VV-ECMO,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal zoonosis. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with four-quadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive Leptospira IgM and real-time PCR. Serial bronchoscopies showed old and fresh clots, but not the classical progressive late red tinge of the returned lavage fluid. After eight days, VV-ECMO was weaned, he was extubated three days later, and made a full recovery. At 9 months follow-up, he was clinically better, with resolution of the CT scan findings and near normal lung function, albeit with low normal gas transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.",0,"Leptospirosis as an important differential of pulmonary haemorrhage on the intensive care unit: a case managed with VV-ECMO BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal zoonosis.

Inflammatory Correlated Response in Two Lines of Rabbit Selected Divergently for Litter Size Environmental Variability,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Animal welfare is a priority objective for the livestock industry. Litter size environmental variability has been related to environmental sensitivity. A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out successfully in rabbits over thirteen generations. The low line showed a lower inflammatory response and susceptibility to infectious disorders than the high line. In conclusion, the decrease of environmental sensitivity seems to increase the adaptation of the animal to the environment, and thus, its welfare. ABSTRACT: A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out in rabbits over thirteen generations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response in the two lines of the experiment, in order to analyse the effect of selection on susceptibility to diseases after challenging to stressful situations, such as 24 h after the first delivery. A total of 78 females were used in this study, 39 from each line. The line selected for litter size heterogeneity (the high line) showed lower white blood leukocyte count (WBC; −0.87 × 10(3)/µL), lower percentage of basophils (−0.11%), higher concentration of TNF-α (+13.8 pg/mL), and greater concentration of CRP (+38.1 µg/mL) than the line selected for litter size homogeneity (the low line). The high line had also higher concentrations of bilirubin, cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to the low line (difference between lines were +0.08 µmol/L, +0.14 µmol/L, +0.35 U/L and +2.4 U/L, respectively). The high line showed higher inflammatory response than the low line, in accordance with a larger susceptibility to infectious disorders. In conclusion, the line selected to increase litter size environmental variability seems to have poor capacity coping with environmental stressors. Therefore, selection for litter size environmental variability can be a useful way to improve animal welfare.",0,"Inflammatory Correlated Response in Two Lines of Rabbit Selected Divergently for Litter Size Environmental Variability SIMPLE SUMMARY: Animal welfare is a priority objective for the livestock industry.

Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease,"Carefully calibrated transmission models have the potential to guide public health officials on the nature and scale of the interventions required to control epidemics. In the context of the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, Drake and colleagues, in this issue of PLOS Biology, employed an elegant modeling approach to capture the distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community and health care settings in the context of changing population behaviors and increasing hospital capacity. Their findings underscore the role of increasing the rate of safe burials and the fractions of infectious individuals who seek hospitalization together with hospital capacity to achieve epidemic control. However, further modeling efforts of EVD transmission and control in West Africa should utilize the spatial-temporal patterns of spread in the region by incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the transmission process. Detailed datasets are urgently needed to characterize temporal changes in population behaviors, contact networks at different spatial scales, population mobility patterns, adherence to infection control measures in hospital settings, and hospitalization and reporting rates.",0,"Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease Carefully calibrated transmission models have the potential to guide public health officials on the nature and scale of the interventions required to control epidemics.

Comparative analysis of serologic cross-reactivity using convalescent sera from filovirus-experimentally infected fruit bats,"With the exception of Reston and Bombali viruses, the marburgviruses and ebolaviruses (family Filoviridae) cause outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in sub-Saharan Africa. The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) is a natural reservoir host for the marburgviruses and evidence suggests that bats are also natural reservoirs for the ebolaviruses. Although the search for the natural reservoirs of the ebolaviruses has largely involved serosurveillance of the bat population, there are no validated serological assays to screen bat sera for ebolavirus-specific IgG antibodies. Here, we generate filovirus-specific antisera by prime-boost immunization of groups of captive ERBs with all seven known culturable filoviruses. After validating a system of filovirus-specific indirect ELISAs utilizing infectious-based virus antigens for detection of virus-specific IgG antibodies from bat sera, we assess the level of serological cross-reactivity between the virus-specific antisera and heterologous filovirus antigens. This data is then used to generate a filovirus antibody fingerprint that can predict which of the filovirus species in the system is most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection. Our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system will be a critical tool for identifying bat species with high ebolavirus seroprevalence rates to target for longitudinal studies aimed at establishing natural reservoir host-ebolavirus relationships.",0,"Comparative analysis of serologic cross-reactivity using convalescent sera from filovirus-experimentally infected fruit bats With the exception of Reston and Bombali viruses, the marburgviruses and ebolaviruses (family Filoviridae) cause outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in sub-Saharan Africa.

Impact of Preexisting Circulating Effector T cells on the Outcome of ABO-Incompatible Adult LDLT,"Our aim was to clarify the significance of phenotype of circulating CD8 T(+) cells on the outcome of ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Twenty-six recipients undergoing ABO-I LDLT and 92 undergoing ABO-compatible (ABO-C) LDLT were classified into three groups according to preoperative proportion of CD8 T(+) cells: naive-dominant (group I), effector memory-dominant (group II), and effector-dominant (group III) recipients. The clinical courses were analyzed. The results showed that in ABO-C groups I and II and in ABO-I group I, effector cells remained above the pretransplant levels after tacrolimus administration. However, in ABO-C group III and ABO-I groups II and III, effector cells were down-regulated for a prolonged period, along with markedly decreased perforin expression and frequent life-threatening complications. ABO-I group II and group III recipients had higher infection rates. It was concluded that recipients with preexisting high effector CD8 T(+) cells are unfavorable candidates for ABO-I LDLT.",0,"Impact of Preexisting Circulating Effector T cells on the Outcome of ABO-Incompatible Adult LDLT Our aim was to clarify the significance of phenotype of circulating CD8 T(+) cells on the outcome of ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).

"Immunomodulators: interleukins, interferons, and IV immunoglobulin","The outstanding progress in immunology and the development of new technologies have resulted in the introduction of new immunotherapies, the so-called “immunomodulators”, for autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, allograft rejection, and cancer. These immunomodulators comprise recombinant cytokines and specific blocking or depleting antibodies. Many of these therapies achieve their effect by stimulating the release of cytokines. The term cytokines includes interleukins (IL-), chemokines, growth factors, interferons (IFN), colony stimulating factors (CSF), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF). These molecules are involved in inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, tissue injury and repair. These new therapeutic tools can be associated with side effects among which nephrotoxicity. The most common immunomodulators associated with nephrotoxicity are described in Table 1.

Systemic Immunomodulatory Effects of Combinatorial Treatment of Thalidomide and Dexamethasone on T Cells and Other Immune Cells,"PURPOSE: In organ transplantation, the need for immune modulation rather than immune suppression has been emphasized. In this study, we investigated whether combinatorial treatments of with thalidomide (TM) and dexamethasone (DX) might be new approaches to induce systemic immunomodulation on T cells and other immune cells that regulate the expression of co-inhibitory molecules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Naïve splenic T cells from C57BL/6 mice were sort-purified and cultured in vitro for CD4(+) T cell proliferation and regulatory T cell (Treg) conversion in the presence of TM or/and DX. Expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) in proliferated and converted T cells was quantified by flow cytometry. We also quantified in vivo expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on splenic CD4(+) T cells and other immune cells isolated from TM- or/and DX-treated mice. Mixed lymphocytes reactions (MLR) were performed to evaluate the capacity of immune cells in carrying out immune responses. RESULTS: CTLA-4 expressions in effector T cells in vivo and in Tregs in vivo/vitro significantly increased upon TM/DX combinatorial treatment. Corresponding to increased CTLA-4 expression in T cells, the expression of ligand molecules for CTLA-4 significantly increased in splenic dendritic cells in TM/DX-treated groups. In addition, MLR results demonstrated that splenocytes isolated from TM/DX-treated mice significantly suppressed the proliferation of T cells isolated from other strains. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we suggest that TM/DX combinatorial treatments might be efficient immunomodulatory methods for regulating T cell immunity.",0,"Systemic Immunomodulatory Effects of Combinatorial Treatment of Thalidomide and Dexamethasone on T Cells and Other Immune Cells PURPOSE: In organ transplantation, the need for immune modulation rather than immune suppression has been emphasized.

CladeOScope: functional interactions through the prism of clade-wise co-evolution,"Mapping co-evolved genes via phylogenetic profiling (PP) is a powerful approach to uncover functional interactions between genes and to associate them with pathways. Despite many successful endeavors, the understanding of co-evolutionary signals in eukaryotes remains partial. Our hypothesis is that ‘Clades’, branches of the tree of life (e.g. primates and mammals), encompass signals that cannot be detected by PP using all eukaryotes. As such, integrating information from different clades should reveal local co-evolution signals and improve function prediction. Accordingly, we analyzed 1028 genomes in 66 clades and demonstrated that the co-evolutionary signal was scattered across clades. We showed that functionally related genes are frequently co-evolved in only parts of the eukaryotic tree and that clades are complementary in detecting functional interactions within pathways.

Despite many successful endeavors, the understanding of co-evolutionary signals in eukaryotes remains partial. Our hypothesis is that ‘Clades’, branches of the tree of life (e.g. primates and mammals), encompass signals that cannot be detected by PP using all eukaryotes. As such, integrating information from different clades should reveal local co-evolution signals and improve function prediction. Accordingly, we analyzed 1028 genomes in 66 clades and demonstrated that the co-evolutionary signal was scattered across clades. We showed that functionally related genes are frequently co-evolved in only parts of the eukaryotic tree and that clades are complementary in detecting functional interactions within pathways.

HIV Antigen Incorporation within Adenovirus Hexon Hypervariable 2 for a Novel HIV Vaccine Approach,"Adenoviral (Ad) vectors have been used for a variety of vaccine applications including cancer and infectious diseases. Traditionally, Ad-based vaccines are designed to express antigens through transgene expression of a given antigen. However, in some cases these conventional Ad-based vaccines have had sub-optimal clinical results. These sub-optimal results are attributed in part to pre-existing Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) immunity. In order to circumvent the need for antigen expression via transgene incorporation, the “antigen capsid-incorporation” strategy has been developed and used for Ad-based vaccine development in the context of a few diseases. This strategy embodies the incorporation of antigenic peptides within the capsid structure of viral vectors. The major capsid protein hexon has been utilized for these capsid incorporation strategies due to hexon's natural role in the generation of anti-Ad immune response and its numerical representation within the Ad virion. Using this strategy, we have developed the means to incorporate heterologous peptide epitopes specifically within the major surface-exposed domains of the Ad capsid protein hexon. Our study herein focuses on generation of multivalent vaccine vectors presenting HIV antigens within the Ad capsid protein hexon, as well as expressing an HIV antigen as a transgene. These novel vectors utilize HVR2 as an incorporation site for a twenty-four amino acid region of the HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER), derived from HIV glycoprotein gp41 (gp41). Our study herein illustrates that our multivalent anti-HIV vectors elicit a cellular anti-HIV response. Furthermore, vaccinations with these vectors, which present HIV antigens at HVR2, elicit a HIV epitope-specific humoral immune response.",0,"HIV Antigen Incorporation within Adenovirus Hexon Hypervariable 2 for a Novel HIV Vaccine Approach Adenoviral (Ad) vectors have been used for a variety of vaccine applications including cancer and infectious diseases.

Toll-Interacting Protein in Pulmonary Diseases. Abiding by the Goldilocks Principle,"TOLLIP (Toll-interacting protein) is an intracellular adaptor protein with diverse actions throughout the body. In a context- and cell type–specific manner, TOLLIP can function as an inhibitor of inflammation and endoplasmic-reticulum stress, an activator of autophagy, or a critical regulator of intracellular vacuole trafficking. The distinct functions of this protein have been linked to innate immune responses and lung epithelial-cell apoptosis. TOLLIP genetic variants have been associated with a variety of chronic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation, and with infections, such as tuberculosis, Legionella pneumonia, and respiratory viruses. TOLLIP exists in a delicate homeostatic balance, with both positive and negative effects on the trajectory of pulmonary diseases. This translational review summarizes the genetic and molecular associations that link TOLLIP to the development and progression of noninfectious and infectious pulmonary diseases. We highlight current limitations of in vitro and in vivo models in assessing the role of TOLLIP in these conditions, and we describe future approaches that will enable a more nuanced exploration of the role of TOLLIP in pulmonary conditions. There has been a surge in recent research evaluating the role of this protein in human diseases, but critical mechanistic pathways require further exploration. By understanding its biologic functions in disease-specific contexts, we will be able to determine whether TOLLIP can be therapeutically modulated to treat pulmonary diseases.",0,"Toll-Interacting Protein in Pulmonary Diseases.

Spatiotemporal reconstruction and transmission dynamics during the 2016–17 H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic in Italy,"Effective control of avian diseases in domestic populations requires understanding of the transmission dynamics facilitating viral emergence and spread. In 2016–17, Italy experienced a significant avian influenza epidemic caused by a highly pathogenic A(H5N8) virus, which affected domestic premises housing around 2.7 million birds, primarily in the north‐eastern regions with the highest density of poultry farms (Lombardy, Emilia‐Romagna and Veneto). We perform integrated analyses of genetic, spatiotemporal and host data within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. Using continuous and discrete phylogeography, we estimate the locations of movements responsible for the spread and persistence of the epidemic. The information derived from these analyses on rates of transmission between regions through time can be used to assess the success of control measures. Using an approach based on phylogenetic–temporal distances between domestic cases, we infer the presence of cryptic wild bird‐mediated transmission, information that can be used to complement existing epidemiological methods for distinguishing transmission within the domestic population from incursions across the wildlife–domestic interface, a common challenge in veterinary epidemiology. Spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic reveals a highly skewed distribution of virus movements with a high proportion of shorter distance local movements interspersed with occasional long‐distance dispersal events associated with wild birds. We also show how such inference be used to identify possible instances of human‐mediated movements where distances between phylogenetically linked domestic cases are unusually high.",0,"Spatiotemporal reconstruction and transmission dynamics during the 2016–17 H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic in Italy Effective control of avian diseases in domestic populations requires understanding of the transmission dynamics facilitating viral emergence and spread.

The In Ovo Delivery of CpG Oligonucleotides Protects against Infectious Bronchitis with the Recruitment of Immune Cells into the Respiratory Tract of Chickens,"The in ovo delivery of cytosine-guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) protects chickens against many bacterial and viral infections, by activating the toll-like receptor (TLR)21 signaling pathway. Although the delivery of CpG ODNs in ovo at embryo day (ED) 18 has been shown to reduce infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) loads in embryonic chicken lungs pre-hatch, whether in ovo delivered CpG ODNs are capable of protecting chickens against a post-hatch challenge is unknown. Thus, our objectives were to determine the protective effect of the in ovo delivery of CpG ODNs at ED 18 against IBV infection encountered post-hatch and, then, to investigate the mechanisms of protection. We found significantly higher survival rates and reduced IBV infection in the chickens following the pre-treatment of the ED 18 eggs with CpG ODNs. At 3 days post infection (dpi), we found an increased recruitment of macrophages, cluster of differentiation (CD)8α+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, and an up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA in the respiratory tract of the chickens. Overall, it may be inferred that CpG ODNs, when delivered in ovo, provide protection against IBV infection induced morbidity and mortality with an enhanced immune response.",0,"The In Ovo Delivery of CpG Oligonucleotides Protects against Infectious Bronchitis with the Recruitment of Immune Cells into the Respiratory Tract of Chickens The in ovo delivery of cytosine-guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) protects chickens against many bacterial and viral infections, by activating the toll-like receptor (TLR)21 signaling pathway.

Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks,"In this study, we present representative human contact networks among Chinese college students. Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period. Our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control.",0,"Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks In this study, we present representative human contact networks among Chinese college students.

COVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE): A Tool and a Web Portal to Extract Drug - Target Protein Associations from the CORD-19 Corpus of Scientific Publications on COVID-19,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a widespread effort to identify drug candidates and biological targets of relevance to SARS-COV-2 infection, which resulted in large numbers of publications on this subject. We have built the COVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE), a web application to extract, curate, and annotate essential drug-target relationships from the research literature on COVID-19 to assist drug repurposing efforts. Materials and Methods: SciBiteAI ontological tagging of the COVID Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a repository of COVID-19 scientific publications, was employed to identify drug-target relationships. Entity identifiers were resolved through lookup routines using UniProt and DrugBank. A custom algorithm was used to identify co-occurrences of protein and drug terms, and confidence scores were calculated for each entity pair. Results: COKE processing of the current CORD-19 database identified about 3,000 drug-protein pairs, including 29 unique proteins and 500 investigational, experimental, and approved drugs. Some of these drugs are presently undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19. Discussion: The rapidly evolving situation concerning the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic growth of publications on this subject in a short period. These circumstances call for methods that can condense the literature into the key concepts and relationships necessary for insights into SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing. Conclusion: The COKE repository and web application deliver key drug - target protein relationships to researchers studying SARS-CoV-2.

Integrating 3D structural information into systems biology,"Systems biology is a data-heavy field that focuses on systems-wide depictions of biological phenomena necessarily sacrificing a detailed characterization of individual components. As an example, genome-wide protein interaction networks are widely used in systems biology and continuously extended and refined as new sources of evidence become available. Despite the vast amount of information about individual protein structures and protein complexes that has accumulated in the past 50 years in the Protein Data Bank, the data, computational tools, and language of structural biology are not an integral part of systems biology. However, increasing effort has been devoted to this integration, and the related literature is reviewed here. Relationships between proteins that are detected via structural similarity offer a rich source of information not available from sequence similarity, and homology modeling can be used to leverage Protein Data Bank structures to produce 3D models for a significant fraction of many proteomes. A number of structure-informed genomic and cross-species (i.e., virus–host) interactomes will be described, and the unique information they provide will be illustrated with a number of examples. Tissue- and tumor-specific interactomes have also been developed through computational strategies that exploit patient information and through genetic interactions available from increasingly sensitive screens. Strategies to integrate structural information with these alternate data sources will be described.

RNA Sequencing of H3N2 Influenza Virus-Infected Human Nasal Epithelial Cells from Multiple Subjects Reveals Molecular Pathways Associated with Tissue Injury and Complications,"The human nasal epithelium is the primary site of exposure to influenza virus, the initiator of host responses to influenza and the resultant pathologies. Influenza virus may cause serious respiratory infection resulting in major complications, as well as severe impairment of the airways. Here, we elucidated the global transcriptomic changes during H3N2 infection of human nasal epithelial cells from multiple individuals. Using RNA sequencing, we characterized the differentially-expressed genes and pathways associated with changes occurring at the nasal epithelium following infection. We used in vitro differentiated human nasal epithelial cell culture model derived from seven different donors who had no concurrent history of viral infections. Statistical analysis highlighted strong transcriptomic signatures significantly associated with 24 and 48 h after infection, but not at the earlier 8-h time point. In particular, we found that the influenza infection induced in the nasal epithelium early and altered responses in interferon gamma signaling, B-cell signaling, apoptosis, necrosis, smooth muscle proliferation, and metabolic alterations.

Role of the adaptive immune response in sepsis,"Sepsis is a syndrome of shock and dysfunction of multiple vital organs that is caused by an uncontrolled immune response to infection and has a high mortality rate. There are no therapies for sepsis, and it has become a global cause for concern. Advances in patient care and management now mean that most patients survive the initial hyper-inflammatory phase of sepsis but progress to a later immunosuppressed phase, where 30% of patients die due to secondary infection. Deficits in the adaptive immune response may play a major role in sepsis patient mortality. The adaptive immune response involves a number of cell types including T cells, B cells and dendritic cells, all with immunoregulatory roles aimed at limiting damage and returning immune homeostasis after infection or insult. However, in sepsis, adaptive immune cells experience cell death or exhaustion, meaning that they have defective effector and memory responses ultimately resulting in an ineffective or suppressed immune defence. CD4+ T cells seem to be the most susceptible to cell death during sepsis and have ensuing defective secretory profiles and functions. Regulatory T cells seem to evade apoptosis and contribute to the immune suppression observed with sepsis. Preclinical studies have identified a number of new targets for therapy in sepsis including anti-apoptotic agents and monoclonal antibodies aimed at reducing cell death, exhaustion and maintaining/restoring adaptive immune cell functions. While early phase clinical trials have demonstrated safety and encouraging signals for biologic effect, larger scale clinical trial testing is required to determine whether these strategies will prove effective in improving outcomes from sepsis.",0,"Role of the adaptive immune response in sepsis Sepsis is a syndrome of shock and dysfunction of multiple vital organs that is caused by an uncontrolled immune response to infection and has a high mortality rate.

Neuronal octopamine signaling regulates mating-induced germline stem cell increase in female Drosophila melanogaster,"Stem cells fuel the development and maintenance of tissues. Many studies have addressed how local signals from neighboring niche cells regulate stem cell identity and their proliferative potential. However, the regulation of stem cells by tissue-extrinsic signals in response to environmental cues remains poorly understood. Here we report that efferent octopaminergic neurons projecting to the ovary are essential for germline stem cell (GSC) increase in response to mating in female Drosophila. The neuronal activity of the octopaminergic neurons is required for mating-induced GSC increase as they relay the mating signal from sex peptide receptor-positive cholinergic neurons. Octopamine and its receptor Oamb are also required for mating-induced GSC increase via intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Moreover, we identified Matrix metalloproteinase-2 as a downstream component of the octopamine-Ca(2+) signaling to induce GSC increase. Our study provides a mechanism describing how neuronal system couples stem cell behavior to environmental cues through stem cell niche signaling.",0,"Neuronal octopamine signaling regulates mating-induced germline stem cell increase in female Drosophila melanogaster Stem cells fuel the development and maintenance of tissues.

Natural Compounds of Marine Origin as Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD): Potential Role for Cancer Interception and Therapy,"Regulated cell death (RCD) has always been considered a tolerogenic event. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurs as a consequence of tumour cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), triggering an immune response. ICD plays a major role in stimulating the function of the immune system in cancer during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. ICD can therefore represent one of the routes to boost anticancer immune responses. According to the recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (2018), apoptosis (type I cell death) and necrosis (type II cell death) represent are not the only types of RCD, which also includes necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and others. Specific downstream signalling molecules and death-inducing stimuli can regulate distinct forms of ICD, which develop and promote the immune cell response. Dying cells deliver different potential immunogenic signals, such as DAMPs, which are able to stimulate the immune system. The acute exposure of DAMPs can prime antitumour immunity by inducing activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), leading to the downstream response by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells (NK). As ICD represents an important target to direct and develop new pharmacological interventions, the identification of bioactive natural products, which are endowed with low side effects, higher tolerability and preferentially inducing immunogenic programmed cell death, represents a priority in biomedical research. The ability of ICD to drive the immune response depends on two major factors, neither of which is intrinsic to cell death: ‘Antigenicity and adjuvanticity’. Indeed, the use of natural ICD-triggering molecules, alone or in combination with different (immuno)therapies, can result in higher efficacy and tolerability. Here, we focused on natural (marine) compounds, particularly on marine microalgae derived molecules such as exopolysaccharides, sulphated polysaccharides, glycopeptides, glycolipids, phospholipids, that are endowed with ICD-inducing properties and sulfavants. Here, we discuss novel and repurposed small-molecule ICD triggers, as well as their ability to target important molecular pathways including the IL-6, TNF-α and interferons (IFNs), leading to immune stimulation, which could be used alone or in combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategies in cancer prevention and therapies.",0,"Natural Compounds of Marine Origin as Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD): Potential Role for Cancer Interception and Therapy Regulated cell death (RCD) has always been considered a tolerogenic event.

Accelerating skin wound healing by M-CSF through generating SSEA-1 and -3 stem cells in the injured sites,"Wound healing is a complicated process requiring the collaborative efforts of different cell lineages. Our recent studies have found that one subset of hematopoietic cells can be induced to dedifferentiate into multipotent stem cells by means of a proliferating fibroblast releasable factor, M-CSF. Understanding the importance of stem cells on skin wound healing, here we evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF on skin wound healing. In an in vivo mouse skin excisional wound model, we found that SSEA-positive stem cells were present in wounded but not normal skin. After isolating skin cells from either normal or wounded skin by collagenase digestion, and analyzing the SSEA-1 positive cells by flow cytometry, we found a significant increase in the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin. Topical application of M-CSF in skin wounds accelerated healing remarkably, while application of M-CSF-neutralizing antibody slowed wound healing. Furthermore, injection of EGFP-labeled hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells generated from M-CSF treated splenocytes resulted in EGFP-labeled cells being enriched in the skin wound site and further differentiated into functional organ-specific cells. Together, these data demonstrated that M-CSF makes a significant contribution to the healing process by inducing hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation into stem cells.",0,"Accelerating skin wound healing by M-CSF through generating SSEA-1 and -3 stem cells in the injured sites Wound healing is a complicated process requiring the collaborative efforts of different cell lineages.

Multiplex Evaluation of Influenza Neutralizing Antibodies with Potential Applicability to In-Field Serological Studies,"The increased number of outbreaks of H5 and H7 LPAI and HPAI viruses in poultry has major public and animal health implications. The continuous rapid evolution of these subtypes and the emergence of new variants influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive, readily standardized influenza serological assays.

This assay permits the measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera. Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine, chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay.

Amplified Concern for Social Risk in Adolescence: Development and Validation of a New Measure,"In adolescence, there is a heightened propensity to take health risks such as smoking, drinking or driving too fast. Another facet of risk taking, social risk, has largely been neglected. A social risk can be defined as any decision or action that could lead to an individual being excluded by their peers, such as appearing different to one’s friends. In the current study, we developed and validated a measure of concern for health and social risk for use in individuals of 11 years and over (N = 1399). Concerns for both health and social risk declined with age, challenging the commonly held stereotype that adolescents are less worried about engaging in risk behaviours, compared with adults. The rate of decline was steeper for social versus health risk behaviours, suggesting that adolescence is a period of heightened concern for social risk. We validated our measure against measures of rejection sensitivity, depression and risk-taking behaviour. Greater concern for social risk was associated with increased sensitivity to rejection and greater depressed mood, and this association was stronger for adolescents compared with adults. We conclude that social risks should be incorporated into future models of risk-taking behaviour, especially when they are pitted against health risks.",0,"Amplified Concern for Social Risk in Adolescence: Development and Validation of a New Measure In adolescence, there is a heightened propensity to take health risks such as smoking, drinking or driving too fast. Another facet of risk taking, social risk, has largely been neglected. A social risk can be defined as any decision or action that could lead to an individual being excluded by their peers, such as appearing different to one’s friends. In the current study, we developed and validated a measure of concern for health and social risk for use in individuals of 11 years and over (N = 1399). Concerns for both health and social risk declined with age, challenging the commonly held stereotype that adolescents are less worried about engaging in risk behaviours, compared with adults. The rate of decline was steeper for social versus health risk behaviours, suggesting that adolescence is a period of heightened concern for social risk. We validated our measure against measures of rejection sensitivity, depression and risk-taking behaviour. Greater concern for social risk was associated with increased sensitivity to rejection and greater depressed mood, and this association was stronger for adolescents compared with adults.

Epigenetics in modulating immune functions of stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,"Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in cancer cells has been extensively studied in recent decades, resulting in the FDA approval of multiple epigenetic agents for treating different cancer types. Recent studies have revealed novel roles of epigenetic dysregulation in altering the phenotypes of immune cells and tumor-associated stromal cells, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells. As a result, epigenetic dysregulation of these cells reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME), changing it from an antitumor environment to an immunosuppressive environment. Here, we review recent studies demonstrating how specific epigenetic mechanisms drive aspects of stromal and immune cell differentiation with implications for the development of solid tumor therapeutics, focusing on the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) TME as a representative of solid tumors. Due to their unique ability to reprogram the TME into a more immunopermissive environment, epigenetic agents have great potential for sensitizing cancer immunotherapy to augment the antitumor response, as an immunopermissive TME is a prerequisite for the success of cancer immunotherapy but is often not developed with solid tumors. The idea of combining epigenetic agents with cancer immunotherapy has been tested both in preclinical settings and in multiple clinical trials. In this review, we highlight the basic biological mechanisms underlying the synergy between epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy and discuss current efforts to translate this knowledge into clinical benefits for patients.",0,"Epigenetics in modulating immune functions of stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in cancer cells has been extensively studied in recent decades, resulting in the FDA approval of multiple epigenetic agents for treating different cancer types.

Allele-Specific Expression of CD4(+) T Cells in Response to Marek’s Disease Virus Infection,"Marek’s disease (MD) is a T cell lymphoma disease induced by Marek’s disease virus (MDV), a highly oncogenic α herpesvirus primarily affecting chickens. MD is a chronic infectious disease that threatens the poultry industry. However, the mechanisms of genetic resistance for MD are complex and not completely understood. In this study, to identify high-confidence candidate genes of MD genetic resistance, high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to obtain transcriptomic data of CD4(+) T cells isolated from MDV-infected and non-infected groups of two reciprocal crosses of individuals mating by two highly inbred chicken lines (6(3) MD-resistant and 7(2) MD-susceptible). After RNA-seq analysis with two biological replicates in each group, we identified 61 and 123 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) annotated in 39 and 132 genes in intercrosses 6(3) × 7(2) and 7(2) × 6(3), respectively, which exhibited allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection. Similarly, we identified 62 and 79 SNPs annotated in 66 and 96 genes in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. We identified 534 and 1543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR < 0.05) related to MDV infection in intercrosses 6(3) × 7(2) and 7(2) × 6(3), respectively. We also identified 328 and 20 DEGs in infected and non-infected groups, respectively. The qRT-PCR using seven DEGs further verified our results of RNA-seq analysis. The qRT-PCR of 11 important ASE genes was performed for gene functional validation in CD4(+) T cells and tumors. Combining the analyses, six genes (MCL1, SLC43A2, PDE3B, ADAM33, BLB1, and DMB2), especially MCL1, were highlighted as the candidate genes with the potential to be involved in MDV infection. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that many ASE genes are linked to T cell activation, T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathways, which play potentially important roles in MDV infection. Our approach underlines the importance of comprehensive functional studies for gaining valuable biological insight into the genetic factors behind MD and other complex traits, and our findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms of MD and disease resistance breeding in poultry.",0,"Allele-Specific Expression of CD4(+) T Cells in Response to Marek’s Disease Virus Infection Marek’s disease (MD) is a T cell lymphoma disease induced by Marek’s disease virus (MDV), a highly oncogenic α herpesvirus primarily affecting chickens.

Potential Demand for Respirators and Surgical Masks During a Hypothetical Influenza Pandemic in the United States,"Background. To inform planning for an influenza pandemic, we estimated US demand for N95 filtering facepiece respirators (respirators) by healthcare and emergency services personnel and need for surgical masks by pandemic patients seeking care. Methods. We used a spreadsheet-based model to estimate demand for 3 scenarios of respirator use: base case (usage approximately follows epidemic curve), intermediate demand (usage rises to epidemic peak and then remains constant), and maximum demand (all healthcare workers use respirators from pandemic onset). We assumed that in the base case scenario, up to 16 respirators would be required per day per intensive care unit patient and 8 per day per general ward patient. Outpatient healthcare workers and emergency services personnel would require 4 respirators per day. Patients would require 1.2 surgical masks per day. Results and Conclusions. Assuming that 20% to 30% of the population would become ill, 1.7 to 3.5 billion respirators would be needed in the base case scenario, 2.6 to 4.3 billion in the intermediate demand scenario, and up to 7.3 billion in the maximum demand scenario (for all scenarios, between 0.1 and 0.4 billion surgical masks would be required for patients). For pandemics with a lower attack rate and fewer cases (eg, 2009-like pandemic), the number of respirators needed would be higher because the pandemic would have longer duration. Providing these numbers of respirators and surgical masks represents a logistic challenge for US public health agencies. Public health officials must urgently consider alternative use strategies for respirators and surgical masks during a pandemic that may vary from current practices.",0,"Potential Demand for Respirators and Surgical Masks During a Hypothetical Influenza Pandemic in the United States Background.

Case report – Gluteal hematoma in two spinal cord patients on enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: evidence needed for a wiser choice,"INTRODUCTION: Acute spinal cord injury is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Low-molecular-weight heparins are first-line medications for both the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. Pharmacological prophylaxis may be indicated for high-risk patients and low-risk patients may be managed with non-pharmacological measures. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of gluteal hematomas that occurred in patients with chronic spinal cord injury who were under prophylactic doses of enoxaparin at a tertiary rehabilitation hospital. There was no local trauma. The patients needed multiple surgical interventions and rehabilitation treatment was delayed. DISCUSSION: There is a lack of evidence to correctly estimate the thromboembolic risk in chronic spinal cord injury and the duration of prophylaxis. Over-prescription of pharmacological prophylaxis may expose patients to unnecessary risks. These patients frequently present with polypharmacy and reducing the amount of prescribed medication may begin with reducing prophylactic treatments for venous thromboembolism, which may be an overtreatment based on risk overestimation.",0,"Case report – Gluteal hematoma in two spinal cord patients on enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: evidence needed for a wiser choice INTRODUCTION: Acute spinal cord injury is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

Emergence of oscillations in a simple epidemic model with demographic data,"A simple susceptible–infectious–removed epidemic model for smallpox, with birth and death rates based on historical data, produces oscillatory dynamics with remarkably accurate periodicity. Stochastic population data cause oscillations to be sustained rather than damped, and data analysis regarding the oscillations provides insights into the same set of population data. Notably, oscillations arise naturally from the model, instead of from a periodic forcing term or other exogenous mechanism that guarantees oscillation: the model has no such mechanism. These emergent natural oscillations display appropriate periodicity for smallpox, even when the model is applied to different locations and populations. The model and datasets, in turn, offer new observations about disease dynamics and solution trajectories. These results call for renewed attention to relatively simple models, in combination with datasets from real outbreaks.",0,"Emergence of oscillations in a simple epidemic model with demographic data A simple susceptible–infectious–removed epidemic model for smallpox, with birth and death rates based on historical data, produces oscillatory dynamics with remarkably accurate periodicity.

Computational evaluation of anticipated PE_PGRS39 protein involvement in host–pathogen interplay and its integration into vaccine development,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year, which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen. Its success depends on its interaction with the host and its ability to regulate the host’s immune system for its own survival. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv (Mtb) proteome consists of unique PE_PGRS family proteins, which present a significant role in bacterial pathogenesis over the past years. Earlier evidence suggests that some PE_PGRS proteins display fibronectin-binding activity. In this manuscript, computational characterization of the PE_PGRS39 protein has indicated something peculiar about this protein. Investigation showed that PE_PGRS39 is an extracellular protein that, instead of acting as fibronectin-binding protein, might mimic fibronectin which binds to alpha-5 beta-1 (α5β1) integrin. PE_PGRS39 protein additionally turned into proven pieces of evidence to have motifs such as DXXG and GGXGXD and PXXP that bind with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), calcium, and host Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, respectively, in conjunction with RGD-integrin binding. These interactions designate the direct role of PE_PGRS39 in bacterial pathogenesis via cell adhesion and signaling. Additionally, the analysis showed that PE_PGRS39 is an antigenic protein and epitope prediction provided functional regions of the protein that trigger a cellular immune response facilitated by T or B cells. Further, an experimental analysis could also open up new avenues for developing novel drugs by targeting signaling motifs or novel vaccines using functional epitopes that could evoke an immune response in the host.",0,"Computational evaluation of anticipated PE_PGRS39 protein involvement in host–pathogen interplay and its integration into vaccine development Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 1 million deaths every year, which is higher than any other bacterial pathogen.

Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila,"Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution. As a result, Drosophila can be used to deconstruct many of the key events in host-pathogen interactions by using a wealth of well-developed molecular and genetic tools. In this review, we aim to emphasize the great leverage provided by the suite of genomic and classical genetic approaches available in flies for decoding details of host-pathogen interactions; these findings can then be applied to studies in higher organisms. We first briefly summarize the general strategies by which Drosophila resists and responds to pathogens. We then focus on how recently developed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens conducted in cells and flies, combined with classical genetic methods, have provided molecular insight into host-pathogen interactions, covering examples of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Finally, we discuss novel strategies for how flies can be used as a tool to examine how specific isolated virulence factors act on an intact host.",0,"Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution.

RNA Interference Targeted to the Conserved Dimerization Initiation Site (DIS) of HIV-1 Restricts Virus Escape Mutation,"Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting viral or cellular genes can effectively inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. This inhibition, however, may induce mutations in the targeted gene, leading to rapid escape from the shRNA-induced inhibition. We generated a lymphoid cell line that stably expressed a 19-bp shRNA targeting a well-conserved dimerization initiation site (DIS) of HIV-1, which strongly inhibited viral replication, thereby delaying virus escape. Furthermore, treatment of HIV-1 infection with DIS- and vif-shRNA combination therapy resulted in superior anti-viral responses compared to vif-shRNA monotherapy. Continuous challenge with HIV-1, however, generated virus mutants that could overcome the RNA interference restriction.

Human Influenza Virus Infections,"Seasonal and pandemic influenza are the two faces of respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses in humans. As seasonal influenza occurs on an annual basis, the circulating virus strains are closely monitored and a yearly updated vaccination is provided, especially to identified risk populations. Nonetheless, influenza virus infection may result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, frequently complicated by bacterial coinfection. Pandemics are, in contrary, unexpected rare events related to the emergence of a reassorted human-pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) strains that often causes increased morbidity and spreads extremely rapidly in the immunologically naive human population, with huge clinical and economic impact. Accordingly, particular efforts are made to advance our knowledge on the disease biology and pathology and recent studies have brought new insights into IAV adaptation mechanisms to the human host, as well as into the key players in disease pathogenesis on the host side. Current antiviral strategies are only efficient at the early stages of the disease and are challenged by the genomic instability of the virus, highlighting the need for novel antiviral therapies targeting the pulmonary host response to improve viral clearance, reduce the risk of bacterial coinfection, and prevent or attenuate acute lung injury. This review article summarizes our current knowledge on the molecular basis of influenza infection and disease progression, the key players in pathogenesis driving severe disease and progression to lung failure, as well as available and envisioned prevention and treatment strategies against influenza virus infection.",0,"Human Influenza Virus Infections Seasonal and pandemic influenza are the two faces of respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses in humans.

Accordingly, particular efforts are made to advance our knowledge on the disease biology and pathology and recent studies have brought new insights into IAV adaptation mechanisms to the human host, as well as into the key players in disease pathogenesis on the host side. Current antiviral strategies are only efficient at the early stages of the disease and are challenged by the genomic instability of the virus, highlighting the need for novel antiviral therapies targeting the pulmonary host response to improve viral clearance, reduce the risk of bacterial coinfection, and prevent or attenuate acute lung injury. This review article summarizes our current knowledge on the molecular basis of influenza infection and disease progression, the key players in pathogenesis driving severe disease and progression to lung failure, as well as available and envisioned prevention and treatment strategies against influenza virus infection.",human influenza virus infections seasonal and pandemic influenza are the two faces of respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses in humans as seasonal influenza occurs on an annual basis the circulating virus strains are closely monitored and a yearly updated vaccination is provided especially to identified risk populations nonetheless influenza virus infection may result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure frequently complicated by bacterial coinfection pandemics are in contrary unexpected rare events related to the emergence of a reassorted humanpathogenic influenza a virus iav strains that often causes increased morbidity and spreads extremely rapidly in the immunologically naive human population with huge clinical and economic impact accordingly particular efforts are made to advance our knowledge on the disease biology and pathology and recent studies have brought new insights into iav adaptation mechanisms to the human host as well as into the key players in disease pathogenesis on the host side current antiviral strategies are only efficient at the early stages of the disease and are challenged by the genomic instability of the virus highlighting the need for novel antiviral therapies targeting the pulmonary host response to improve viral clearance reduce the risk of bacterial coinfection and prevent or attenuate acute lung injury this review article summarizes our current knowledge on the molecular basis of influenza infection and disease progression the key players in pathogenesis driving severe disease and progression to lung failure as well as available and envisioned prevention and treatment strategies against influenza virus infection,1

AIDS research and its role in China’s AIDS prevention and control policies,"By the end of 2005, the estimated number of HIV infected people in China was 650,000. The seriousness of the epidemic calls for effective control measures to tackle the problems in order to avoid the tragedy in Africa from happening in China. “Prevention First” is the cornerstone of the country’s health policy. On 2003 World AIDS Day, Premier Jiabao Wen announced a new national AIDS control policy, “Four Frees and One Care”. This policy clearly shows that the Chinese government has once again taken full responsibility to solve public health problems and has profound impact far beyond the AIDS field. In early 2006, the central government put scientific and technology innovation as a national priority and set the target to build an innovative China by year 2020. Since then, the government has been increasing investment in science and technology with major emphasis on both infectious diseases control and new drug research and development. For the first time, development of 100 new drugs and control of major infectious diseases (AIDS, HBV, TB and other emerging infectious diseases) have been selected as national key scientific projects. China’s best minds in related fields will be pooled to work together in order to remove the technical barriers blocking efficient control of the major infectious disease in China. Knowledge on molecular epidemiology, immunology, pathogenesis, HAART, as well as HIVDR strains will certainly provide urgently needed scientific information for China’s AIDS control program. Only evidence-based strategy from good research will provide long-term effective control of AIDS.",0,"AIDS research and its role in China’s AIDS prevention and control policies By the end of 2005, the estimated number of HIV infected people in China was 650,000.

A multi-regions discrete-time epidemic model with a travel-blocking vicinity optimal control approach on patches,"We study, in this paper, infection dynamics when an epidemic emerges to many regions which are connected with their neighbors by any kind of anthropological movement. For this, we devise a multi-regions discrete-time model with the three classical SIR compartments, describing the spatial-temporal behaviors of homogenous susceptible, infected and removed populations. We suppose a large geographical domain, presented by a grid of colored cells, to exhibit at each instant i the spatial propagation of an epidemic which affects its different parts or sub-domains that we call here cells or regions. In order to minimize the number of infected individuals in some regions, we suggest an optimal control approach based on a travel-blocking vicinity strategy which aims to control a group of cells, or a patch, by restricting movements of infected people coming from its neighboring cells. We apply a discrete version of Pontryagin’s maximum principle to state the necessary conditions and characterization of the travel-blocking optimal controls. We provide cellular simulations based on discrete progressive-regressive iterative schemes associated with the obtained multi-points boundary value problems. For illustrating the modeling and optimal control approaches, we consider an example of 100 regions.",0,"A multi-regions discrete-time epidemic model with a travel-blocking vicinity optimal control approach on patches We study, in this paper, infection dynamics when an epidemic emerges to many regions which are connected with their neighbors by any kind of anthropological movement.

mTOR Inhibitors as Radiosensitizers in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms,"Peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) has evolved as an important second-line treatment option in the management of inoperable and metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). Though high radiation doses can be delivered to the tumors, complete remission is still rare. Radiosensitization prior to PRRT is therefore considered to be a promising strategy to improve the treatment effect. In this study, effect and mechanism of mTOR inhibitors were investigated in a comprehensive panel of five NEN cell lines (BON, QGP-1, LCC-18, H727, UMC-11), employing assays for cellular proliferation, clonogenic survival, cell cycle modification and signaling. mTOR inhibition lead to growth arrest with a biphasic concentration-response pattern: a partial response at approximately 1 nM and full response at micromolar concentrations (8–48 µM). All cell lines demonstrated elevated p70S6K phosphorylation yet also increased phosphorylation of counterregulatory Akt. The pulmonary NEN cell line UMC-11 showed the lowest induction of phospho-Akt and strongest growth arrest by mTOR inhibitors. Radiation sensitivity of the cells (50% reduction versus control) was found to range between 4 and 8 Gy. Further, mTOR inhibition was employed together with irradiation to evaluate radiosensitizing effects of this combination treatment. mTOR inhibition was found to radiosensitize all five NEN cells in an additive manner with a moderate overall effect. The radiation-induced G2/M arrest was diminished under combination treatment, leading to an increased G1 arrest. Further investigation involving a suitable animal model as well as radioligand application such as (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC will have to demonstrate the full potential of this strategy for radiosensitization in NEN.",0,"mTOR Inhibitors as Radiosensitizers in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) has evolved as an important second-line treatment option in the management of inoperable and metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN).

Reducing mortality in sepsis: new directions,"Considerable progress has been made in the past few years in the development of therapeutic interventions that can reduce mortality in sepsis. However, encouraging physicians to put the results of new studies into practice is not always simple. A roundtable was thus convened to provide guidance for clinicians on the integration and implementation of new interventions into the intensive care unit (ICU). Five topics were selected that have been shown in randomized, controlled trials to reduce mortality: limiting the tidal volume in acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, early goal-directed therapy, use of drotrecogin alfa (activated), use of moderate doses of steroids, and tight control of blood sugar. One of the principal investigators for each study was invited to participate in the roundtable. The discussions and questions that followed the presentation of data by each panel member enabled a consensus recommendation to be derived regarding when each intervention should be used. Each new intervention has a place in the management of patients with sepsis. Furthermore, and importantly, the therapies are not mutually exclusive; many patients will need a combination of several approaches – an 'ICU package'. The present article provides guidelines from experts in the field on optimal patient selection and timing for each intervention, and provides advice on how to integrate new therapies into ICU practice, including protocol development, so that mortality rates from this disease process can be reduced.",0,"Reducing mortality in sepsis: new directions Considerable progress has been made in the past few years in the development of therapeutic interventions that can reduce mortality in sepsis.

A Novel Virus Causes Scale Drop Disease in Lates calcarifer,"From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia. The most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales. It was referred to as scale drop syndrome, but the etiology remained enigmatic. By using a next-generation virus discovery technique, VIDISCA-454, sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish. The near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined, which shows a unique genome organization, and low levels of identity to known members of the Iridoviridae. Based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins, the virus is a novel member of the Megalocytivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. The virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture, where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected Asian seabass kidney and brain cells. Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm, characteristic for the Iridoviridae. In vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in Asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish. These findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome, as each of Koch’s postulates is fulfilled. We have named the virus Scale Drop Disease Virus. Vaccines prepared from BEI- and formalin inactivated virus, as well as from E. coli produced major capsid protein provide efficacious protection against scale drop disease.",0,"A Novel Virus Causes Scale Drop Disease in Lates calcarifer From 1992 onwards, outbreaks of a previously unknown illness have been reported in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) kept in maricultures in Southeast Asia.

Significance of new lung infiltrates in outpatients after lung and heart–lung transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Infection and rejection represent major complications following lung transplantation and are often associated with pulmonary infiltrates. The differential diagnosis of these infiltrates depends on their timing after transplantation. The aim of this study was to characterize lung transplant recipients (LTR) presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all LTR and heart–lung transplant recipients attending outpatient follow‐up at our institution between September 1, 2006 and October 14, 2011 was performed. All patients presenting with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x‐ray who underwent bronchoscopy were included. RESULTS: A total of 913 patients accounted for 13,156 attendances, with 3,912 bronchoscopies being performed. Seventy‐eight patients (9%) exhibited new pulmonary infiltrates and proceeded to bronchoscopy. Infiltrates occurred at a median 15 (interquartile range [IQR] 5–39) months after transplantation. Forty‐eight patients (62%) were male, and median patient age was 47 (IQR 29–57) years. Subsequent investigation revealed pneumonia to be the underlying cause in 63 patients (81%). In the remaining patients, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was responsible in 6 (8%), acute rejection in 5 (6%), and toxic pneumonitis in 4 (5%) patients. Overall 1‐year survival in LTR presenting with new infiltrates was 97%, compared with 96% for all LTR attending our Outpatient Department. CONCLUSIONS: New pulmonary infiltrates occurring after the first month in LTR are most likely due to infection. Through prompt diagnosis and treatment, early mortality appears unaffected. Late mortality remains attributable to CLAD.",0,"Significance of new lung infiltrates in outpatients after lung and heart–lung transplantation BACKGROUND: Infection and rejection represent major complications following lung transplantation and are often associated with pulmonary infiltrates.

Air Passenger Travel and International Surveillance Data Predict Spatiotemporal Variation in Measles Importations to the United States,"Measles incidence in the United States has grown dramatically, as vaccination rates are declining and transmission internationally is on the rise. Because imported cases are necessary drivers of outbreaks in non-endemic settings, predicting measles outbreaks in the US depends on predicting imported cases. To assess the predictability of imported measles cases, we performed a regression of imported measles cases in the US against an inflow variable that combines air travel data with international measles surveillance data. To understand the contribution of each data type to these predictions, we repeated the regression analysis with alternative versions of the inflow variable that replaced each data type with averaged values and with versions of the inflow variable that used modeled inputs. We assessed the performance of these regression models using correlation, coverage probability, and area under the curve statistics, including with resampling and cross-validation. Our regression model had good predictive ability with respect to the presence or absence of imported cases in a given state in a given year (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.78) and the magnitude of imported cases (Pearson correlation = 0.84). By comparing alternative versions of the inflow variable averaging over different inputs, we found that both air travel data and international surveillance data contribute to the model’s ability to predict numbers of imported cases and individually contribute to its ability to predict the presence or absence of imported cases. Predicted sources of imported measles cases varied considerably across years and US states, depending on which countries had high measles activity in a given year. Our results emphasize the importance of the relationship between global connectedness and the spread of measles. This study provides a framework for predicting and understanding imported case dynamics that could inform future studies and outbreak prevention efforts.",0,"Air Passenger Travel and International Surveillance Data Predict Spatiotemporal Variation in Measles Importations to the United States Measles incidence in the United States has grown dramatically, as vaccination rates are declining and transmission internationally is on the rise.

Risk modifiers of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis: a retrospective analysis of the FORECAST study,"BACKGROUND: Predisposing conditions and risk modifiers instead of causes and risk factors have recently been used as alternatives to identify patients at a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016–March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22–33)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16–28), p < 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06–3.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06–0.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04–5.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05–1.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.",0,"Risk modifiers of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis: a retrospective analysis of the FORECAST study BACKGROUND: Predisposing conditions and risk modifiers instead of causes and risk factors have recently been used as alternatives to identify patients at a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016–March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22–33)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16–28), p < 0.01].

Noninvasive ventilation for pediatric interfacility transports: a retrospective study,"BACKGROUND: To characterize pediatric patients supported with continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP/BiPAP) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) during interfacility transport (IFT). METHODS: A retrospective study with a provincial pediatric transport team from a tertiary hospital pediatric intensive care unit. Pediatric patients aged 28 days to < 17 years, who required IFT between January 2017 and December 2018, were identified through a transport registry and were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 118 (26.7%) patients received CPAP/BIPAP or HFNC support for IFT. The most common respiratory diagnosis was bronchiolitis (46%). These patients were placed on respiratory support, 31.4 minutes after the transport team’s arrival. None required intubation during their IFT, despite mean transport times of 163 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide important information for programs with large catchment areas, in which large distances and transport times should not be barriers to NIV implementation.",0,"Noninvasive ventilation for pediatric interfacility transports: a retrospective study BACKGROUND: To characterize pediatric patients supported with continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP/BiPAP) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) during interfacility transport (IFT).

Haploidentical bone marrow transplant with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease: An update,"Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential. Transplant-eligible patients must be referred to tertiary medical centers for consideration of haplo-HCT.",0,"Haploidentical bone marrow transplant with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease: An update Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease.

“I just wear it and I become normal”: a qualitative study of Tanzanian women’s experiences with long-term vaginal pessary use for stress urinary incontinence,"INTRODUCTION: Previous research has shown that vaginal pessaries are a cost-effective treatment for women worldwide suffering from stress urinary incontinence. However, little is known about African women’s experiences with vaginal pessary use. The aim of this study was to understand the experiences of vaginal pessary use among Tanzanian women who had received long-term pessary treatment for stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: 15 semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted over a 2-month period in 2019 with Tanzanian women living in the Kilimanjaro Region who suffered from stress urinary incontinence and who had been using a pessary for at least 18 months. The interview transcripts were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The primary motivation for seeking treatment were discomfort from symptoms, social consequences and low quality of life. Perceived benefits from pessary use included improved quality of life with reacquired abilities to perform daily activities, participate in social gatherings, feeling symptom relief and improved sexual relations. Further, some women saw pessary treatment as superior to other locally available treatment options. Perceived barriers for pessary use included shame, husband’s disapproval, limited access to treatment and lack of knowledge among the women as well as healthcare personnel. CONCLUSION: Vaginal pessaries are well-perceived as a long-term treatment method among Tanzanian women suffering from stress urinary incontinence. This method may have potential to be implemented large scale in Tanzania if combined with basic health education.",0,"“I just wear it and I become normal”: a qualitative study of Tanzanian women’s experiences with long-term vaginal pessary use for stress urinary incontinence INTRODUCTION: Previous research has shown that vaginal pessaries are a cost-effective treatment for women worldwide suffering from stress urinary incontinence.

Coping Behaviors Mediate Associations between Occupational Factors and Compassion Satisfaction among the Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Assault Workforce,"The intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault (SA) workforce faces significant occupational stressors yet little is known about positive occupational outcomes associated with this work. Therefore, this study analyzed factors associated with compassion satisfaction among the IPV/SA workforce in one southwestern U.S. state (n = 623). Drawing from the Resilience Portfolio Model (Grych et al. 2015), researchers examined the possible role of coping behaviors in mediating associations between compassion satisfaction and workplace resources / assets, perceived job security, and resilience. Analyses revealed partial mediation in the models that included workload, values, and resilience as independent variables, suggesting that these factors both influence workers’ coping behaviors and have an independent association with compassion satisfaction. Models investigating control, rewards, community, fairness, and perceived job security indicated significant total effects of the independent variables on compassion satisfaction. Overall, IPV/SA workers who engaged more frequently in a range of coping behaviors reported higher levels of compassion satisfaction. The findings point to implications for organizational and employee practice, including building in worktime for key individual coping behaviors, balancing workloads among staff members, and enhancing organizational level coping strategies, such as team supervision and team care planning.",0,"Coping Behaviors Mediate Associations between Occupational Factors and Compassion Satisfaction among the Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Assault Workforce The intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault (SA) workforce faces significant occupational stressors yet little is known about positive occupational outcomes associated with this work.

CLINICAL VIRAL INFECTIONS AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,"Over an 8 year period, 170 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 134 healthy controls were assessed at monthly intervals in order to ascertain environmental factors which might be important in producing exacerbation or progression of the illness, and to compare the frequency of common viral infections in the two groups. During cumulative periods designated ""at risk"" (2 weeks before the onset of infection until 5 weeks afterwards) annual exacerbation rates were almost 3-fold greater than those during periods not at risk. Approximately 9% of infections were temporally related to exacerbations, whereas 27% of exacerbations were related to infections. Frequency of common infections was approximately 20-50% less in MS patients than controls; it was progressively less in those with greater disability. Even in minimally disabled patients with similar potential for infectious contacts, the infection rate was significantly less than in controls, suggesting that MS patients could have superior immune defences against common viruses.",0,"CLINICAL VIRAL INFECTIONS AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Over an 8 year period, 170 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 134 healthy controls were assessed at monthly intervals in order to ascertain environmental factors which might be important in producing exacerbation or progression of the illness, and to compare the frequency of common viral infections in the two groups.

A novel submicron emulsion system loaded with vincristine–oleic acid ion-pair complex with improved anticancer effect: in vitro and in vivo studies,"BACKGROUND: Vincristine (VCR), which is a widely used antineoplastic drug, was integrated with a submicron-emulsion drug-delivery system to enhance the anticancer effect. METHODS: After the formation of a VCR-oleic acid ion-pair complex (VCR-OA), the VCR-OA-loaded submicron emulsion (VCR-OA-SME), prepared by classical high-pressure homogenization, was characterized and its in vitro anticancer effects were evaluated. RESULTS: The submicron-emulsion formulation exhibited a homogeneous round shape. The mean particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were 157.6 ± 12.6 nm, −26.5 ± 5.0 mV and 78.64% ± 3.44%, respectively. An in vitro release study of the VCR-OA-SME revealed that 12.4% of the VCR was released within the first 2 hours (initial burst-release phase) and the rest of the drug was detected in the subsequent sustained-release phase. Compared with VCR solution, the pharmacokinetic study of VCR-OA-SME showed relatively longer mean residence time (mean residence time [0–∞] increased from 187.19 to 227.56 minutes), higher maximum concentration (from 252.13 ng/mL to 533.34 ng/mL), and greater area under the curve (area under the curve [0–∞] from 11,417.77 μg/L/minute to 17,164.34 μg/L/minute. Moreover, the VCR-OA-SME exhibited higher cytotoxicity (P < 0.05) on tumor cells by inducing cell arrest in the G2/M phase or even apoptosis (P < 0.05).

Longitudinal Association of a Medication Risk Score With Mortality Among Ambulatory Patients Acquired Through Electronic Health Record Data,"The use of electronic health records allows for the application of a novel medication risk score for the rapid identification of ambulatory patients at risk of adverse drug events. We sought to examine the longitudinal association of medication risk score with mortality. This retrospective cohort study included patients whose data were available through electronic health records from multiple health care organizations in the United States that provided data as part of a Patient Safety Organization. Patients were included if they had ≥1 visit and ≥1 medication in their record between January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between continuous and categorized medication risk score with all-cause mortality. Among 427,103 patients, the median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 29–64 years); 61% were female; 50% were White, 11% were Black, and 38% were Hispanic; and 6873 had a death date recorded. Patients 30 to 49 years old had the highest hazard ratios (HRs), followed by the 50- to 64-year-olds and lastly those 65 years or older. Controlling for all covariates, 30- to 49-year-olds with a score of 20 to 30 (versus <10) had a 604% increase in the hazard of death (HR, 7.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.86–12.85), 50- to 64-year-olds had a 254% increase (HR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.71–4.63), and ≥65-year-olds had an 87% increase (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.67–2.09). The medication risk score was independently associated with death, adjusting for multimorbidities and other conditions. Risk was found to vary by age group and score. Results suggest that pharmaceutical interventions among those with elevated scores could improve medication safety for patients taking multiple medications.",0,"Longitudinal Association of a Medication Risk Score With Mortality Among Ambulatory Patients Acquired Through Electronic Health Record Data The use of electronic health records allows for the application of a novel medication risk score for the rapid identification of ambulatory patients at risk of adverse drug events.

ADAM17 is an essential attachment factor for classical swine fever virus,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is an important pathogen in the swine industry. Virion attachment is mediated by envelope proteins E(rns) and E2, and E2 is indispensable. Using a pull-down assay with soluble E2 as the bait, we demonstrated that ADAM17, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, is essential for CSFV entry. Loss of ADAM17 in a permissive cell line eliminated E2 binding and viral entry, but compensation with pig ADAM17 cDNA completely rescued these phenotypes. Similarly, ADAM17 silencing in primary porcine fibroblasts significantly impaired virus infection. In addition, human and mouse ADAM17, which is highly homologous to pig ADAM17, also mediated CSFV entry. The metalloproteinase domain of ADAM17 bound directly to E2 protein in a zinc-dependent manner. A surface exposed region within this domain was mapped and shown to be critical for CSFV entry. These findings clearly demonstrate that ADAM17 serves as an essential attachment factor for CSFV.",0,"ADAM17 is an essential attachment factor for classical swine fever virus Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is an important pathogen in the swine industry.

Treatment with hyperimmune equine immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin fragments completely protects rodents from Ebola virus infection,"Recent successes with monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp(TM) and MIL77 against Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics. Since the production process for monoclonal antibodies can be prolonged and costly, alternative treatments should be investigated. We produced purified equine antisera from horses hyperimmunized with EBOV virus-like particles, and tested the post-exposure efficacy of the antisera in a mouse model of infection. BALB/c mice were given up to 2 mg of purified equine antisera per animal, at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi), in which all animals survived. To decrease the possibility of serum sickness, the equine antisera was digested with pepsin to generate F(ab′)(2) fragments, with in vitro neutralizing activity comparable to whole immunoglobulin. Full protection was achieved with when treatment was initiated at 1 dpi, but the suboptimal protection observed with the 30 minute and 2 dpi groups demonstrate that in addition to virus neutralization, other Fc-dependent antibody mechanisms may also contribute to survival. Guinea pigs given 20 mg of antisera or F(ab′)(2) at or starting at 1 or 2 dpi were also fully protected from EBOV infection.

Porcine Interferon Complex and Co-Evolution with Increasing Viral Pressure after Domestication,"Consisting of nearly 60 functional genes, porcine interferon (IFN)-complex represents an evolutionary surge of IFN evolution in domestic ungulate species. To compare with humans and mice, each of these species contains about 20 IFN functional genes, which are better characterized using the conventional IFN-α/β subtypes as examples. Porcine IFN-complex thus represents an optimal model for studying IFN evolution that resulted from increasing viral pressure during domestication and industrialization. We hypothesize and justify that porcine IFN-complex may extend its functionality in antiviral and immunomodulatory activity due to its superior molecular diversity. Furthermore, these unconventional IFNs could even confer some functional and signaling novelty beyond that of the well-studied IFN-α/β subtypes. Investigations into porcine IFN-complex will further our understanding of IFN biology and promote IFN-based therapeutic designs to confront swine viral diseases.",0,"Porcine Interferon Complex and Co-Evolution with Increasing Viral Pressure after Domestication Consisting of nearly 60 functional genes, porcine interferon (IFN)-complex represents an evolutionary surge of IFN evolution in domestic ungulate species.

"1 Viruses, virulence and pathogenicity","Pathogenicity is a complex process with stringent requirements of both the host cell and the infecting virion. Among these requirements are a port of entry into host cells, a means of replication for the virus, and a means by which infection damages host cells. Damage to the host can result from multiple mechanisms including transformation, suppression of cellular metabolism, apoptosis, autoimmune responses directed against infected or uninfected tissues, or by molecular mimicry. In the attempt to identify new associations between viral infection and disease, investigators should be mindful that variable host factors as well as viral infection may be required for pathogenesis. Efforts to associate specific viral infections with specific diseases may be obscured by final common pathways through which multiple agents damage host cells in similar ways.",0,"1 Viruses, virulence and pathogenicity Pathogenicity is a complex process with stringent requirements of both the host cell and the infecting virion.

Reconstruction of cell spatial organization from single-cell RNA sequencing data based on ligand-receptor mediated self-assembly,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized transcriptomic studies by providing unprecedented cellular and molecular throughputs, but spatial information of individual cells is lost during tissue dissociation. While imaging-based technologies such as in situ sequencing show great promise, technical difficulties currently limit their wide usage. Here we hypothesize that cellular spatial organization is inherently encoded by cell identity and can be reconstructed, at least in part, by ligand-receptor interactions, and we present CSOmap, a computational tool to infer cellular interaction de novo from scRNA-seq. We show that CSOmap can successfully recapitulate the spatial organization of multiple organs of human and mouse including tumor microenvironments for multiple cancers in pseudo-space, and reveal molecular determinants of cellular interactions. Further, CSOmap readily simulates perturbation of genes or cell types to gain novel biological insights, especially into how immune cells interact in the tumor microenvironment. CSOmap can be a widely applicable tool to interrogate cellular organizations based on scRNA-seq data for various tissues in diverse systems.",0,"Reconstruction of cell spatial organization from single-cell RNA sequencing data based on ligand-receptor mediated self-assembly Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized transcriptomic studies by providing unprecedented cellular and molecular throughputs, but spatial information of individual cells is lost during tissue dissociation.

Assessment of Prescription Opioid Medical Use and Misuse Among Parents and Their Adolescent Offspring in the US,"IMPORTANCE: Limited information is available regarding the association between parental and adolescent medical prescription opioid use and misuse in the US. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between parental and adolescent prescription opioid medical use and misuse. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, nationally representative study included 15 200 parent-adolescent dyads from the annual 2015-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Data were collected from January 6, 2015, to December 20, 2017, and analyzed from October 4, 2019, to October 15, 2020. EXPOSURES: Parental past 12-month exclusive medical prescription opioid use and any misuse (ie, using without a prescription or in any way not directed by a physician). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adolescent past 12-month medical prescription opioid use or misuse. Multivariable regressions estimated associations between parental and offspring medical prescription opioid use or misuse, controlling for sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: Respondents included 9400 mother-child and 5800 father-child dyads in the same household; children were aged 12 to 17 years (52.8% male; mean [SD] age, 14.5 [1.7] years). Controlling for other factors, parental medical prescription opioid use was associated with adolescent prescription opioid medical use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53) and misuse (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25), whereas parental misuse was not. Parental medical prescription stimulant use was associated with adolescent medical prescription opioid use (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91). Parental marijuana use (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.13-2.99), parent-adolescent conflict (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.52), and adolescent depression (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.26-2.44) were associated with adolescent prescription opioid misuse. Adolescent delinquency (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.38-1.74) and perceived schoolmates’ drug use (aOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.95-4.23) were also associated with adolescent misuse and more weakly with medical use (aORs, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.22] and 1.61 [95% CI, 1.32-1.96], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Youth use of prescription opioids is in part a structural/environmental issue. The findings of this study suggest that parental medical prescription opioid use is associated with offspring prescription opioid use, whereas parental misuse is not. Restricting physicians’ opioid prescribing to parents is a crucial public health goal. In addition, parents could be educated on the risks of their prescription opioid use for offspring and on practices to mitigate risk, including safe medication storage and disposal.

Measles Virus as an Oncolytic Immunotherapy,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Measles virus is currently under investigation as an innovative cancer treatment. The virus selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. Furthermore, it can be genetically engineered to increase tumor specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, treatment with measles virus activates antitumor immune responses. A number of clinical trials using measles virus for cancer treatment have been completed or are ongoing. Future studies will further harness the possibilities of virus engineering and potential of combination immunotherapies to improve clinical outcome. ABSTRACT: Measles virus (MeV) preferentially replicates in malignant cells, leading to tumor lysis and priming of antitumor immunity. Live attenuated MeV vaccine strains are therefore under investigation as cancer therapeutics. The versatile MeV reverse genetics systems allows for engineering of advanced targeted, armed, and shielded oncolytic viral vectors. Therapeutic efficacy can further be enhanced by combination treatments. An emerging focus in this regard is combination immunotherapy, especially with immune checkpoint blockade. Despite challenges arising from antiviral immunity, availability of preclinical models, and GMP production, early clinical trials have demonstrated safety of oncolytic MeV and yielded promising efficacy data. Future clinical trials with engineered viruses, rational combination regimens, and comprehensive translational research programs will realize the potential of oncolytic immunotherapy.",0,"Measles Virus as an Oncolytic Immunotherapy SIMPLE SUMMARY: Measles virus is currently under investigation as an innovative cancer treatment.

Antibody-based therapeutic interventions: possible strategy to counter chikungunya viral infection,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted disease that belongs to the genus Alphaviruses, has been emerged as an epidemic threat over the last two decades, and the recent co-emergence of this virus along with other circulating arboviruses and comorbidities has influenced atypical mortality rate up to 10%. Genetic variation in the virus has resulted in its adaptability towards the new vector Aedes albopictus other than Aedes aegypti, which has widen the horizon of distribution towards non-tropical and non-endemic areas. As of now, no licensed vaccines or therapies are available against CHIKV; the treatment regimens for CHIKV are mostly symptomatic, based on the clinical manifestations. Development of small molecule drugs and neutralizing antibodies are potential alternatives of worth investigating until an efficient or safe vaccine is approved. Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in antiviral immunity, and their presence is a hallmark of viral infection. In this review, we describe prospects for effective vaccines and highlight importance of neutralizing antibody-based therapeutic and prophylactic applications to combat CHIKV infections. We further discuss about the progress made towards CHIKV therapeutic interventions as well as challenges and limitation associated with the vaccine development. Furthermore this review describes the lesson learned from chikungunya natural infection, which could help in better understanding for future development of antibody-based therapeutic measures.",0,"Antibody-based therapeutic interventions: possible strategy to counter chikungunya viral infection Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted disease that belongs to the genus Alphaviruses, has been emerged as an epidemic threat over the last two decades, and the recent co-emergence of this virus along with other circulating arboviruses and comorbidities has influenced atypical mortality rate up to 10%.

Quantification and phenotypic characterisation of peripheral IFN-γ producing leucocytes in chickens vaccinated against Newcastle disease,"The aim of this study was to optimise and evaluate an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for assessment of T cell IFN-γ responses in chickens vaccinated against Newcastle disease (ND). We aimed to validate currently available antibodies to chicken IFN-γ using transfected CHO cells. Moreover, this ICS assay was evaluated for use to detect mitogen and antigen induced IFN-γ production in chicken peripheral blood leucocytes. Chickens from an inbred white leghorn line containing two MHC haplotypes, B19 and B21, were divided into three experimental groups; one group was kept as naive controls, one group was vaccinated intramuscularly twice with a commercial inactivated ND virus (NDV) vaccine, and the last group was vaccinated orally twice with a commercial live attenuated NDV vaccine. PBMC were ex vivo stimulated with ConA or with NDV antigen. The ICS assay was used to determine the phenotype and frequency of IFN-γ positive cells. ConA stimulation induced extensive IFN-γ production in both CD3(+)TCRγδ(+) (γδ T cells) cells and CD3(+)TCRγδ(−) cells (αβ T cells), but no significant differences were observed between the experimental groups. Furthermore, a large proportion of the IFN-γ producing cells were CD3(−) indicating that other cells than classic T cells, secreted this cytokine. NDV antigen stimulation induced IFN-γ production but to a lower extent than ConA and with a large variation between individuals. The CD3(+)TCR1γδ(−)CD8α(+) (CTL) population produced the highest NDV specific IFN-γ responses, with significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ producing cells in the B19 chickens vaccinated orally with live attenuated NDV vaccine. This was not the case in the B21 animals, indicating a haplotype restricted variation. In contrast, the CD3(+)TCR1γδ(−)CD4(+) (Th) population did not show a significant increase in IFN-γ production in NDV stimulated samples which was in part due to a high number of IFN-γ producing cells after incubation with medium alone. In conclusion, an ICS assay for phenotyping of IFN-γ producing chicken leukocytes was set up that proved useful in identifying cytokine producing cells upon either mitogen or antigen-specific stimulation.",0,"Quantification and phenotypic characterisation of peripheral IFN-γ producing leucocytes in chickens vaccinated against Newcastle disease The aim of this study was to optimise and evaluate an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for assessment of T cell IFN-γ responses in chickens vaccinated against Newcastle disease (ND).

Fluctuations in influenza-like illness epidemics and suicide mortality: A time-series regression of 13-year mortality data in South Korea,"AIMS: We explored the association between influenza epidemic and suicide mortality rates in a large population using a time-series regression of 13-year mortality data in South Korea. METHODS: Weekly suicide mortalities and influenza-like illness (ILI) were analyzed using time series regression. Regression coefficient for suicide mortality based on percentage change of ILI was calculated using a quasi-Poisson regression. Non-linear distributed lag models with quadratic function up to 24 weeks were constructed. RESULTS: The association between ILI and suicide mortality increased significantly up to 8 weeks post-influenza diagnosis. A significant positive association between ILI and suicide mortality was observed from 2009, when a novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus provoked a worldwide pandemic. No meaningful association between these factors was observed before 2009. CONCLUSION: There was a significant positive relationship between ILI and suicide mortality after 2009, when a novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus provoked a worldwide pandemic.",0,"Fluctuations in influenza-like illness epidemics and suicide mortality: A time-series regression of 13-year mortality data in South Korea AIMS: We explored the association between influenza epidemic and suicide mortality rates in a large population using a time-series regression of 13-year mortality data in South Korea.

Development of an Artificial Intelligence–Based Automated Recommendation System for Clinical Laboratory Tests: Retrospective Analysis of the National Health Insurance Database,"BACKGROUND: Laboratory tests are considered an essential part of patient safety as patients’ screening, diagnosis, and follow-up are solely based on laboratory tests. Diagnosis of patients could be wrong, missed, or delayed if laboratory tests are performed erroneously. However, recognizing the value of correct laboratory test ordering remains underestimated by policymakers and clinicians. Nowadays, artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning (DL) have been extensively used as powerful tools for pattern recognition in large data sets. Therefore, developing an automated laboratory test recommendation tool using available data from electronic health records (EHRs) could support current clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence–based automated model that can provide laboratory tests recommendation based on simple variables available in EHRs. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the National Health Insurance database between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, was performed. We reviewed the record of all patients who visited the cardiology department at least once and were prescribed laboratory tests. The data set was split into training and testing sets (80:20) to develop the DL model. In the internal validation, 25% of data were randomly selected from the training set to evaluate the performance of this model. RESULTS: We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, and hamming loss as comparative measures. A total of 129,938 prescriptions were used in our model. The DL-based automated recommendation system for laboratory tests achieved a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCmacro and AUROCmicro of 0.76 and 0.87, respectively). Using a low cutoff, the model identified appropriate laboratory tests with 99% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The developed artificial intelligence model based on DL exhibited good discriminative capability for predicting laboratory tests using routinely collected EHR data. Utilization of DL approaches can facilitate optimal laboratory test selection for patients, which may in turn improve patient safety. However, future study is recommended to assess the cost-effectiveness for implementing this model in real-world clinical settings.",0,"Development of an Artificial Intelligence–Based Automated Recommendation System for Clinical Laboratory Tests: Retrospective Analysis of the National Health Insurance Database BACKGROUND: Laboratory tests are considered an essential part of patient safety as patients’ screening, diagnosis, and follow-up are solely based on laboratory tests.

Is There a Genetic Predisposition to Postoperative Adhesion Development?,"Adhesions are permanent fibrovascular bands between peritoneal surfaces, which develop following virtually all body cavity surgeries. The susceptibility to develop, and the severity, of adhesions following intra-abdominal surgery varies within and between individuals, suggesting that heritable factors influence adhesion development. In this manuscript, we discuss the pathophysiology of adhesion development from the perspective of genetic susceptibility. We restrict our discussion to genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are specifically involved in, or that cause modification of, the adhesion development process. We performed a literature search using the PubMed database for all relevant English language articles up to March 2020 (n = 186). We identified and carefully reviewed all relevant articles addressing genetic mutations or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that impact the risk for adhesion development. We also reviewed references from these articles for additional information. We found several reported SNPs, genetic mutations, and upregulation of messenger RNAs that directly or indirectly increase the propensity for postoperative adhesion development, namely in genes for transforming growth factor beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, interferon-gamma, matrix metalloproteinase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and the interleukins. An understanding of genetic variants could provide insight into the pathophysiology of adhesion development. The information presented in this review contributes to a greater understanding of adhesion development at the genetic level and may allow modification of these genetic risks, which may subsequently guide management in preventing and treating this challenging complication of abdominal surgery. In particular, the information could help identify patients at greater risk for adhesion development, which would make them candidates for anti-adhesion prophylaxis. Currently, agents to reduce postoperative adhesion development exist, and in the future, development of agents, which specifically target individual genetic profile, would be more specific in preventing intraperitoneal adhesion development.",0,"Is There a Genetic Predisposition to Postoperative Adhesion Development?

Microarrays as Research Tools and Diagnostic Devices,"Molecular diagnostics comprises a main analytical division in clinical laboratory diagnostics. The analysis of RNA or DNA helps to diagnose infectious diseases and identify genetic determined disorders or even cancer. Starting from mono-parametric tests within the last years, technologies have evolved that allow for the detection of many parameters in parallel, e.g., by using multiplex nucleic acid amplification techniques, microarrays, or next-generation sequencing technologies. The introduction of closed-tube systems as well as lab-on-a-chip devices further resulted in a higher automation degree with a reduced contamination risk. These applications complement or even stepwise replace classical methods in clinical microbiology like virus cultures, resistance determination, microscopic and metabolic analyses, as well as biochemical or immunohistochemical assays. In addition, novel diagnostic markers appear, like noncoding RNAs and miRNAs providing additional room for novel biomarkers. This article provides an overview of microarrays as diagnostics devices and research tools. Introduced in 1995 for transcription analysis, microarrays are used today to detect several different biomolecules like DNA, RNA, miRNA, and proteins among others. Mainly used in research, some microarrays also found their way to clinical diagnostics. Further, closed lab-on-a-chip devices that use DNA microarrays as detection tools are discussed, and additionally, an outlook toward applications of next-generation sequencing tools in diagnostics will be given.",0,"Microarrays as Research Tools and Diagnostic Devices Molecular diagnostics comprises a main analytical division in clinical laboratory diagnostics.

"Projections of Ebola outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use in Équateur, Democratic Republic of Congo, as of May 27, 2018","As of May 27, 2018, 6 suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI: 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration.",0,"Projections of Ebola outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use in Équateur, Democratic Republic of Congo, as of May 27, 2018 As of May 27, 2018, 6 suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Role of Type III Interferons in Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Therapy,"The human interferon (IFN) response is a key innate immune mechanism to fight virus infection. IFNs are host-encoded secreted proteins, which induce IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral properties. Among the three classes of IFNs, type III IFNs, also called IFN lambdas (IFNLs), are an essential component of the innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV). In particular, human polymorphisms in IFNL gene loci correlate with hepatitis C disease progression and with treatment response. To date, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly elusive; however it seems clear that viral infection of the liver induces IFNL responses. As IFNL receptors show a more restricted tissue expression than receptors for other classes of IFNs, IFNL treatment has reduced side effects compared to the classical type I IFN treatment. In HCV therapy, however, IFNL will likely not play an important role as highly effective direct acting antivirals (DAA) exist. Here, we will review our current knowledge on IFNL gene expression, protein properties, signaling, ISG induction, and its implications on HCV infection and treatment. Finally, we will discuss the lessons learnt from the HCV and IFNL field for virus infections beyond hepatitis C.",0,"The Role of Type III Interferons in Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Therapy The human interferon (IFN) response is a key innate immune mechanism to fight virus infection.

"The Forgotten Plague: Psychiatric Manifestations of Ebola, Zika, and Emerging Infectious Diseases","The media and public health generally focus on the biological and physical ramifications of epidemics. Mental health issues that coincide with emerging diseases and epidemics are rarely examined and sometimes, even eschewed due to cultural considerations. Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially with a focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness. Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection. Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness. Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations. Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented. While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or fiscal estimates solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations. Therefore, those on the frontlines of epidemics including emergency physicians, primary care providers and infectious disease specialists should serve communicate this need and advocate for sustained and increased funding for mental health programs to heighten public awareness regarding acute psychiatric events during infectious diseases outbreaks and offer treatment and support when necessary.",0,"The Forgotten Plague: Psychiatric Manifestations of Ebola, Zika, and Emerging Infectious Diseases The media and public health generally focus on the biological and physical ramifications of epidemics.

Combined Vision and Hearing Difficulties Results in Higher Levels of Depression and Chronic Anxiety: Data From a Large Sample of Spanish Adults,"OBJECTIVE: Individually, vision and hearing impairments have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression. We investigated the effect of dual sensory impairment (difficulty seeing and hearing) in a large representative sample of Spanish adults. METHODS: Data from a total of 23,089 adults (age range: 15–103 years, 45.9% men) from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 were analyzed. Self-reported difficulty of seeing and hearing (exposures), and depression and chronic anxiety (outcomes) were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was assessed for difficulty with vision alone, hearing alone and with difficulty with both, adjusting for gender, age, marital status, living as a couple, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, use of glasses/contact lenses, and hearing aid. RESULTS: Visual difficulty, hearing difficulty, and dual difficulties were all associated with significantly higher odds for depression (ORs 2.367, 2.098, and 3.852, respectively) and for chronic anxiety (ORs 1.983, 1.942, and 3.385, respectively). Dual sensory difficulty was associated with higher odds ratios for depression and anxiety when compared to either impairment alone. CONCLUSION: Dual sensory difficulty is associated with significantly higher odds of anxiety and depression when compared to either vision or hearing difficulty alone. Appropriate interventions are needed to address any reversible causes of vision and hearing as well as anxiety and depression in people in these specific groups.",0,"Combined Vision and Hearing Difficulties Results in Higher Levels of Depression and Chronic Anxiety: Data From a Large Sample of Spanish Adults OBJECTIVE: Individually, vision and hearing impairments have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression.

Development of VHH Antibodies against Dengue Virus Type 2 NS1 and Comparison with Monoclonal Antibodies for Use in Immunological Diagnosis,"The possibility of using variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies) as diagnostic tools for dengue virus (DENV) type 2 NS1 protein was investigated and compared with the use of conventional monoclonal antibodies. After successful expression of DENV type 2 NS1 protein, the genes of VHH antibodies against NS1 protein were biopanned from a non-immune llama library by phage display. VHH antibodies were then expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Simultaneously, monoclonal antibodies were obtained by the conventional route. Sequence analysis of the VHH antibodies revealed novel and long complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3). Epitope mapping was performed via a phage display peptide library using purified VHH and monoclonal antibodies as targets. Interestingly, the same region of NS1, which comprises amino acids (224)HWPKPHTLW(232), was conserved for both kinds of antibodies displaying the consensus motif histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan or tryptophan-proline-tryptophan. The two types of antibodies were used to prepare rapid diagnostic kits based on immunochromatographic assay. The VHH antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit showed better sensitivity and specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit, which might be due to the long CDR3 regions of the VHH antibodies and their ability to bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen. This demonstrates that VHH antibodies are likely to be an option for developing point-of-care tests against DENV infection.",0,"Development of VHH Antibodies against Dengue Virus Type 2 NS1 and Comparison with Monoclonal Antibodies for Use in Immunological Diagnosis The possibility of using variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies) as diagnostic tools for dengue virus (DENV) type 2 NS1 protein was investigated and compared with the use of conventional monoclonal antibodies.

Prehospital reversal of profound respiratory acidosis and hypercapnic coma by non-invasive ventilation: a report of two cases,"BACKGROUND: In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is generally recommended and has proven its benefits by reducing endotracheal intubation (ETI) rates, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, complications, and mortality. Choosing between immediate ETI or NIV trial is often difficult when such patients present with an altered mental status. Some guidelines recommend avoiding NIV when consciousness is impaired given the risk of aspiration, and some authors suggest that a pH < 7.25 is highly predictive of NIV failure. Though clinical response to a well-adjusted NIV treatment can be both swift and spectacular, these contraindications probably encourage physicians to proceed to immediate ETI. Some studies indeed report that NIV was not even considered in as many as 60% of patients who might have benefited from this therapy, though ETI related complications might have been avoided had NIV been successfully applied. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of ARF in COPD patients who were successfully treated by NIV in prehospital setting and avoided ETI despite contraindications (altered mental status with a Glasgow Coma Scale < 8) and failure risk factors (severe respiratory acidosis with pH < 7.25).

AFM-Based Correlative Microscopy Illuminates Human Pathogens,"Microbes have an arsenal of virulence factors that contribute to their pathogenicity. A number of challenges remain to fully understand disease transmission, fitness landscape, antimicrobial resistance and host heterogeneity. A variety of tools have been used to address diverse aspects of pathogenicity, from molecular host-pathogen interactions to the mechanisms of disease acquisition and transmission. Current gaps in our knowledge include a more direct understanding of host-pathogen interactions, including signaling at interfaces, and direct phenotypic confirmation of pathogenicity. Correlative microscopy has been gaining traction to address the many challenges currently faced in biomedicine, in particular the combination of optical and atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM, generates high-resolution surface topographical images, and quantifies mechanical properties at the pN scale under physiologically relevant conditions. When combined with optical microscopy, AFM probes pathogen surfaces and their physical and molecular interaction with host cells, while the various modes of optical microscopy view internal cellular responses of the pathogen and host.

Innate Immune Responses to Avian Influenza Viruses in Ducks and Chickens,"Mallard ducks are important natural hosts of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and many strains circulate in this reservoir and cause little harm. Some strains can be transmitted to other hosts, including chickens, and cause respiratory and systemic disease. Rarely, these highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause disease in mallards, while chickens are highly susceptible. The long co-evolution of mallard ducks with influenza viruses has undoubtedly fine-tuned many immunological host–pathogen interactions to confer resistance to disease, which are poorly understood. Here, we compare innate responses to different avian influenza viruses in ducks and chickens to reveal differences that point to potential mechanisms of disease resistance. Mallard ducks are permissive to LPAI replication in their intestinal tissues without overtly compromising their fitness. In contrast, the mallard response to HPAI infection reflects an immediate and robust induction of type I interferon and antiviral interferon stimulated genes, highlighting the importance of the RIG-I pathway. Ducks also appear to limit the duration of the response, particularly of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Chickens lack RIG-I, and some modulators of the signaling pathway and may be compromised in initiating an early interferon response, allowing more viral replication and consequent damage. We review current knowledge about innate response mediators to influenza infection in mallard ducks compared to chickens to gain insight into protective immune responses, and open questions for future research.",0,"Innate Immune Responses to Avian Influenza Viruses in Ducks and Chickens Mallard ducks are important natural hosts of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and many strains circulate in this reservoir and cause little harm.

"Comparison of Respiratory Pathogen Detections from Routine Hospital Testing and Expanded Systematic Testing from the Minnesota Severe Acute Respiratory Illness Surveillance Program, 2015–2016","BACKGROUND: Hospital testing for respiratory pathogens is nonsystematic, leading to potential missed detection of clinically relevant pathogens. The Minnesota Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance program monitors hospitalizations due to acute respiratory illness and conducts systematic testing for several respiratory pathogens. We assessed viruses detected by the hospital and additional detections identified by expanded testing. METHODS: Residual upper respiratory specimens collected from patients hospitalized for suspected respiratory illness for routine diagnostic testing at three hospitals, including one children’s hospital, were submitted to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). Specimens were tested for 18 respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. Clinical and hospital test data were collected through medical record review. RESULTS: From September 2015 to August 2016, 2,351 hospitalized SARI patients were reported, with the following age distribution: 57% <5 years, 13% 5–17 years, 30% ≥18 years. Among all SARI patients, 97% (2,273) had hospital-based, clinician-directed testing for viral pathogens. Viruses were detected among 47% (1,077) of tested patients, among which testing methods included PCR (85%), rapid antigen (13%), and culture (2%); 74% were tested on the day of admission. Most common viruses detected by clinical testing included respiratory syncytial virus (41%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (31%), and influenza (15%) (Figure 1). Systematic RT–PCR testing at MDH identified 1,600 (68%) patients positive for ≥1 respiratory virus, identifying previously unknown detections among 35% (820) of SARI patients (Figure 2). Of 1,272 patients with no virus identified at the hospital, 46% (586) had a viral detection at MDH. Patients aged <18 years were significantly more likely to have an additional pathogen detected by MDH testing than those aged ≥18 years (P < 0.01), including rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: Systematic, expanded testing at MDH identified a higher proportion of respiratory pathogens among SARI patients compared with clinical laboratory testing. Additional testing for clinically relevant respiratory pathogens may inform medical decision-making.

Patients aged <18 years were significantly more likely to have an additional pathogen detected by MDH testing than those aged ≥18 years (P < 0.01), including rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: Systematic, expanded testing at MDH identified a higher proportion of respiratory pathogens among SARI patients compared with clinical laboratory testing. Additional testing for clinically relevant respiratory pathogens may inform medical decision-making.

"Molecular Detection, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Identification of Transcription Motifs in Feline Leukemia Virus from Naturally Infected Cats in Malaysia","A nested PCR assay was used to determine the viral RNA and proviral DNA status of naturally infected cats. Selected samples that were FeLV-positive by PCR were subjected to sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and motifs search. Of the 39 samples that were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 87.2% (34/39) were confirmed positive with nested PCR. FeLV proviral DNA was detected in 38 (97.3%) of p27-antigen negative samples. Malaysian FeLV isolates are found to be highly similar with a homology of 91% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates divided into two clusters, with a majority (86.2%) sharing similarity with FeLV-K01803 and fewer isolates (13.8%) with FeLV-GM1 strain. Different enhancer motifs including NF-GMa, Krox-20/WT1I-del2, BAF1, AP-2, TBP, TFIIF-beta, TRF, and TFIID are found to occur either in single, duplicate, triplicate, or sets of 5 in different positions within the U3-LTR-gag region. The present result confirms the occurrence of FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA in naturally infected cats. Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly similar, and a majority of them are closely related to a UK isolate. This study provides the first molecular based information on FeLV in Malaysia. Additionally, different enhancer motifs likely associated with FeLV related pathogenesis have been identified.",0,"Molecular Detection, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Identification of Transcription Motifs in Feline Leukemia Virus from Naturally Infected Cats in Malaysia A nested PCR assay was used to determine the viral RNA and proviral DNA status of naturally infected cats.

Immunological disturbances associated with malarial infection,"Malaria is a reemerging disease in the countries where it was eradicated previously, whereas it is endemic in many countries including tropical countries. In India, malarial infection is on rise due to rapid urbanization and overcrowding in all major metropolitan cities. The incidence of morbidity and mortality due to malaria infection is increasing and could be attributed to drug resistance in strains of malarial parasite. Combining immune modulation strategies with anti-malarial drugs has a beneficial effect in an attempt to improve treatment for malaria. Along with clinical presentation and outcome of this parasitic infection, it is important to understand immunological disturbances associated with biological mechanisms underlying these actions in better understanding of pathogenesis of malarial infection. Immune and inflammatory responses in malarial infection are controlled and co-ordinated by various cytokines and chemokines.

Pandemic simulation of antivirals + school closures: buying time until strain-specific vaccine is available,"A strain-specific vaccine is unlikely to be available in the early phases of a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic. It could be months and at the current production rate may not provide timely protection to the population. Intervention strategies that control the spread of infection will be necessary in this situation, such as the use of the US stockpile of antiviral medication coupled with a 6-month school closure. The agent-based simulation model, EpiSimS, was used to assess the impact of this intervention strategy followed by three different vaccine approaches: (1) 2-dose, 80% effective, (2) 1-dose, 30% effective, and (3) 1 dose, 80% effective. Simulations show that the combination of antivirals, school closures, and a strain-specific vaccine can reduce morbidity and mortality while in effect. A significant second infection wave can occur with current vaccine technology once school closures are relaxed, though an ideal vaccine is able to contain it. In our simulations, worker absenteeism increases in all cases mostly attributed to household adults staying home with children due to the school closures.",0,"Pandemic simulation of antivirals + school closures: buying time until strain-specific vaccine is available A strain-specific vaccine is unlikely to be available in the early phases of a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic.

The Microbial Detection Array Combined with Random Phi29-Amplification Used as a Diagnostic Tool for Virus Detection in Clinical Samples,"A common technique used for sensitive and specific diagnostic virus detection in clinical samples is PCR that can identify one or several viruses in one assay. However, a diagnostic microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could replace hundreds of individual PCR-reactions and remove the need for a clear clinical hypothesis regarding a suspected pathogen. We have established such a diagnostic platform for random amplification and subsequent microarray identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples. We show that Phi29 polymerase-amplification of a diverse set of clinical samples generates enough viral material for successful identification by the Microbial Detection Array, demonstrating the potential of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection. We conclude that this method detects both DNA and RNA virus, present in the same sample, as well as differentiates between different virus subtypes.

Antibody epitope repertoire analysis enables rapid antigen discovery and multiplex serology,"The detection of pathogen-specific antibodies remains a cornerstone of clinical diagnostics. Yet, many test exhibit undesirable performance or are completely lacking. Given this, we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis (SERA), a method to rapidly discover conserved, pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes, and applied it to develop an assay for Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 Chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate Chagas antigens. In a blinded validation set (n = 72), 30/30 Chagas were positive, 30/30 non-Chagas were negative, and 1/12 Leishmania sp. was positive. After unblinding, a Leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel. The Chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity (30/30) and specificity (90/90) in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections. Amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown Chagas serostatus, assay specificity was 99.8% (998/1000). Thus, the Chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity. NGS-based serology via SERA provides an effective approach to discover antigenic epitopes and develop high performance multiplex serological assays.",0,"Antibody epitope repertoire analysis enables rapid antigen discovery and multiplex serology The detection of pathogen-specific antibodies remains a cornerstone of clinical diagnostics.

Influenza surveillance in the Pacific Island countries and territories during the 2009 pandemic: an observational study,"BACKGROUND: Historically, Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) have been more severely affected by influenza pandemics than any other part of the world. We herein describe the emergence and epidemiologic characteristics of pandemic influenza H1N1 in PICTs from 2009 to 2010. METHODS: The World Health Organization gathered reports of influenza-like-illness and laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases from all 23 Pacific island countries and territories, from April 2009 through August 2010. Data were gathered through weekly email reports from Pacific island countries and territories and through email or telephone follow-up. RESULTS: Pacific island countries and territories started detecting pandemic H1N1 cases in June 2009, firstly in French Polynesia, with the last new detection occurring in August 2009 in Tuvalu. Nineteen Pacific island countries and territories reported 1,972 confirmed cases, peaking in August 2009. No confirmed pandemic H1N1 cases were identified in Niue, Pitcairn and Tokelau; the latter instituted strict maritime quarantine. Influenza-like-illness surveillance showed trends similar to surveillance of confirmed cases. Seven Pacific island countries and territories reported 21 deaths of confirmed pandemic H1N1. Case-patients died of acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, or both. The most reported pre-existing conditions were obesity, lung disease, heart disease, and pregnancy. Pacific island countries and territories instituted a variety of mitigation measures, including arrival health screening. Multiple partners facilitated influenza preparedness planning and outbreak response. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic influenza spread rapidly throughout the Pacific despite enormous distances and relative isolation. Tokelau and Pitcairn may be the only jurisdictions to have remained pandemic-free. Despite being well-prepared, Pacific island countries and territories experienced significant morbidity and mortality, consistent with other indigenous and low-resource settings. For the first time, regional influenza-like-illness surveillance was conducted in the Pacific, allowing health authorities to monitor the pandemic’s spread and severity in real-time. Future regional outbreak responses will likely benefit from the lessons learned during this outbreak.",0,"Influenza surveillance in the Pacific Island countries and territories during the 2009 pandemic: an observational study BACKGROUND: Historically, Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) have been more severely affected by influenza pandemics than any other part of the world.

Hospitalization following influenza infection and pandemic vaccination in multiple sclerosis patients: a nationwide population-based registry study from Norway,"Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at increased risk of infections and related worsening of neurological function. Influenza infection has been associated with increased risk of various neurological complications. We conducted a population-based registry study to investigate the risk of acute hospitalization of MS patients in relation to influenza infection or pandemic vaccination in Norway. The entire Norwegian population in the years 2008–2014 was defined as our study population (N = 5,219,296). Information on MS diagnosis, influenza infection and vaccination were provided by Norwegian national registries. The self-controlled case series method was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in defined risk periods. 6755 MS patients were identified during the study period. Average age at first registration of an MS diagnosis was 51.8 years among men and 49.9 years among females (66.9%). The IRR for emergency hospitalization among MS patients the first week after an influenza diagnosis was 3.4 (95% CI 2.4–4.8). The IRR was 5.6 (95% CI 2.7–11.3) after pandemic influenza, and 4.8 (95% CI 3.1–7.4) after seasonal influenza. Pandemic vaccination did not influence risk of hospitalization [IRR within the first week: 0.7 (95% CI 0.5–1.0)]. Among MS patients, influenza infection was associated with increased risk for acute hospitalization while no increased risk was observed after pandemic vaccination.

A Framework of Web GIS Based Unified Public Health Information Visualization Platform,"The GIS plays a vital role in public health information visualization for public health information management, broadcasting, data management, statistical analysis, and decision supporting. This paper described the elementary requirement and the essential technology for public health information visualization and proposed a framework of the unified public health information visualization platform based on the Web GIS and visualization technology. The system framework adopted multi-tier system infrastructure that consist the sever tier and the front tier. In the server tier, the J2EE based architecture was adopted to construct a distrusted system infrastructure. In the front tier, the GIS map java applet is used to show the public health information with spatial graphical map, and the web based graphics figures such as curves, bars, maps and multi-dimensional visualization technology are used to visualize the public health information.

"Effects of Magnesium, Calcium, and Aluminum Chelation on Fluoroquinolone Absorption Rate and Bioavailability: A Computational Study","Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a widespread class of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed as a first line of defense, and, in some cases, as the only treatment against bacterial infection. However, when administered orally, reduced absorption and bioavailability can occur due to chelation in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) with multivalent metal cations acquired from diet, coadministered compounds (sucralfate, didanosine), or drug formulation. Predicting the extent to which this interaction reduces in vivo antibiotic absorption and systemic exposure remains desirable yet challenging. In this study, we focus on quinolone interactions with magnesium, calcium and aluminum as found in dietary supplements, antacids (Maalox) orally administered therapies (sucralfate, didanosine). The effect of FQ–metal complexation on absorption rate was investigated through a combined molecular and pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling study. Quantum mechanical calculations elucidated FQ–metal binding energies, which were leveraged to predict the magnitude of reduced bioavailability via a quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR). This work will help inform clinical FQ formulation design, alert to possible dietary effects, and shed light on drug–drug interactions resulting from coadministration at an earlier stage in the drug development pipeline.",0,"Effects of Magnesium, Calcium, and Aluminum Chelation on Fluoroquinolone Absorption Rate and Bioavailability: A Computational Study Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a widespread class of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed as a first line of defense, and, in some cases, as the only treatment against bacterial infection.

"Severe leukopenia in Staphylococcus aureus-necrotizing, community-acquired pneumonia: risk factors and impact on survival","BACKGROUND: Necrotizing pneumonia attributed to Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive Staphylococcus aureus has mainly been reported in otherwise healthy children and young adults, with a high mortality rate. Erythroderma, airway bleeding, and leukopenia have been shown to be predictive of mortality. The objectives of this study were to define the characteristics of patients with severe leukopenia at 48-h hospitalization and to update our data regarding mortality predicting factors in a larger population than we had previously described. METHODS: It was designed as a case-case study nested in a cohort study. A total of 148 cases of community-acquired, necrotizing pneumonia were included. The following data were collected: basic demographic information, medical history, signs and symptoms, radiological findings and laboratory results during the first 48 h of hospitalization. The study population was divided into 2 groups: (1) with severe leukopenia (leukocyte count ≤3,000 leukocytes/mL, n=62) and (2) without severe leukopenia (>3,000 leukocytes/mL, n=86). RESULTS: Median age was 22 years, and the male-to-female gender ratio was 1.5. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 41.2%. Death occurred in 75.8% of severe leukopenia cases with median survival time of 4 days, and in 16.3% of cases with leukocyte count >3,000/mL (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that the factors associated with severe leukopenia were influenza-like illness (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.45, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) 1.67-11.88, P=0.003), airway bleeding (aOR 4.53, 95% CI 1.85-11.13, P=0.001) and age over 30 years (aOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.08-6.68, P=0.033). A personal history of furuncles appeared to be protective (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.96, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: S. aureus-necrotizing pneumonia is still an extremely severe disease in patients with severe leukopenia. Some factors could distinguish these patients, allowing better initial identification to initiate adapted, rapid administration of appropriate therapy.",0,"Severe leukopenia in Staphylococcus aureus-necrotizing, community-acquired pneumonia: risk factors and impact on survival BACKGROUND: Necrotizing pneumonia attributed to Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive Staphylococcus aureus has mainly been reported in otherwise healthy children and young adults, with a high mortality rate.

"Social Nesting, Animal Welfare, and Disease Monitoring","SIMPLE SUMMARY: Most standardized tools to evaluate welfare and disease progression in animals assess the individuals, while social behaviors are scarcely monitored, despite being useful to detecting acute illness and chronic and mental health problems. The main reason is that social behavior is complex and time-consuming. We are currently using the nests built by animals living together, a species-typical behavior naturally occurring in standard housing conditions, to monitor them. Here, we provide an example of its use to evaluate social deficits and the long-term effects of a neonatal tactile-proprioceptive sensorial treatment from postnatal day 1 to 21, in male and female adult mice modeling Alzheimer’s disease compared to mice with normal aging. Social nesting was worse in the mutants, mostly in males, since the number of days needed to build a perfect nest was longer or unsuccessful in a three-day test. Early life intervention was successful. Social nesting, easily included in housing routines, can be a useful tool to assess animal welfare, monitor disease progress, and evaluate potential risk factors and effects of preventive/therapeutical strategies. Other advantages, such as being a noninvasive, painless, simple, short, and low-cost, rend social nesting feasible to be implemented in most animal department settings. ABSTRACT: The assessment of welfare and disease progression in animal models is critical. Most tools rely on evaluating individual subjects, whereas social behaviors, also sensitive to acute illness, chronic diseases, or mental health, are scarcely monitored because they are complex and time-consuming. We propose the evaluation of social nesting, a species-typical behavior naturally occurring in standard housing conditions, for such behavioral monitoring. We provide an example of its use to evaluate social deficits and the long-term effects of neonatal tactile-proprioceptive sensorial stimulation from postnatal day 1 to 21, in male and female adult 3xTg-AD mice for Alzheimer’s disease compared to sex- and age-matched non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging. Social nesting was sensitive to genotype (worse in 3xTg-AD mice), sex (worse in males), profile, and treatment (distinct time to observe the maximum score and incidence of the perfect nest). Since social nesting can be easily included in housing routines, this neuroethological approach can be useful for animal welfare, monitoring the disease’s progress, and evaluating potential risk factors and effects of preventive/therapeutical strategies. Finally, the noninvasive, painless, simple, short time, and low-cost features of this home-cage monitoring are advantages that make social nesting feasible to be successfully implemented in most animal department settings.",0,"Social Nesting, Animal Welfare, and Disease Monitoring SIMPLE SUMMARY: Most standardized tools to evaluate welfare and disease progression in animals assess the individuals, while social behaviors are scarcely monitored, despite being useful to detecting acute illness and chronic and mental health problems.

Microarray analyses reveal strain-specific antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 variants following natural infection and vaccination,"Vaccines based on Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) have failed due to extensive polymorphism in AMA1. To assess the strain-specificity of antibody responses to malaria infection and AMA1 vaccination, we designed protein and peptide microarrays representing hundreds of unique AMA1 variants. Following clinical malaria episodes, children had short-lived, sequence-independent increases in average whole-protein seroreactivity, as well as strain-specific responses to peptides representing diverse epitopes. Vaccination resulted in dramatically increased seroreactivity to all 263 AMA1 whole-protein variants. High-density peptide analysis revealed that vaccinated children had increases in seroreactivity to four distinct epitopes that exceeded responses to natural infection. A single amino acid change was critical to seroreactivity to peptides in a region of AMA1 associated with strain-specific vaccine efficacy. Antibody measurements using whole antigens may be biased towards conserved, immunodominant epitopes. Peptide microarrays may help to identify immunogenic epitopes, define correlates of vaccine protection, and measure strain-specific vaccine-induced antibodies.",0,"Microarray analyses reveal strain-specific antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 variants following natural infection and vaccination Vaccines based on Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) have failed due to extensive polymorphism in AMA1.

Perioperative circulatory support for lung transplantation,"OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has recently replaced cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as the preferred option for providing circulatory support during lung transplantation. This review aimed to summarize the previous data and to address the relative use of ECMO and CPB during lung transplantation. METHODS: The database was searched in PubMed (Medline) using the following keywords: lung transplantation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and cardiopulmonary bypass, for all relevant reports which were written in English and were published between 2000 and 2020. REVIEW: Several reports have revealed that intraoperative use of ECMO is associated with lower blood product transfusion requirements, shorter ventilator support, and shorter length of hospital stay. During recent years, preoperative ECMO has also been used with favorable outcomes as a bridge to lung transplantation in critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ECMO during lung transplantation seems to reduce postoperative complications and improve short-term outcomes, relative to CPB. However, additional data should be collected through large multicenter randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, preoperative ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation appears to provide favorable outcomes, although additional data are also needed from experienced transplant centers.",0,"Perioperative circulatory support for lung transplantation OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has recently replaced cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as the preferred option for providing circulatory support during lung transplantation.

"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Subgroup A and B Infections in Nasal, Bronchial, Small-Airway, and Organoid-Derived Respiratory Cultures","Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in infants. Two subgroups of HRSV (A and B) routinely cocirculate. Most research has been performed with HRSV-A strains because these are easier to culture than HRSV-B strains. In this study, we aimed to compare the replicative fitness and HRSV-induced innate cytokine responses of HRSV-A and HRSV-B strains in disease-relevant cell culture models. We used two recombinant (r) clinical isolate-based HRSV strains (A11 and B05) and one recombinant laboratory-adapted HRSV strain (A2) to infect commercially available nasal, bronchial, and small-airway cultures. Epithelial cells from all anatomical locations were susceptible to HRSV infection despite the induction of a dominant type III interferon response. Subgroup A viruses disseminated and replicated faster than the subgroup B virus. Additionally, we studied HRSV infection and innate responses in airway organoids (AOs) cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI). Results were similar to the commercially obtained bronchial cells. In summary, we show that HRSV replicates well in cells from both the upper and the lower airways, with a slight replicative advantage for subgroup A viruses. Lastly, we showed that AOs cultured at ALI are a valuable model for studying HRSV ex vivo and that they can be used in the future to study factors that influence HRSV disease severity. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young infants and causes almost 200,000 deaths per year. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment available, only a prophylactic monoclonal antibody (palivizumab). An important question in HRSV pathogenesis research is why only a fraction (1 to 3%) of infants develop severe disease. Model systems comprising disease-relevant HRSV isolates and accurate and reproducible cell culture models are indispensable to study infection, replication, and innate immune responses. Here, we used differentiated AOs cultured at ALI to model the human airways. Subgroup A viruses replicated better than subgroup B viruses, which we speculate fits with epidemiological findings that subgroup A viruses cause more severe disease in infants.

Airway Transmural Pressures in an Airway Tree During Bronchoconstriction in Asthma,"Airway transmural pressure in healthy homogeneous lungs with dilated airways is approximately equal to the difference between intraluminal and pleural pressure. However, bronchoconstriction causes airway narrowing, parenchymal distortion, dynamic hyperinflation, and the emergence of ventilation defects (VDefs) affecting transmural pressure. This study aimed to investigate the changes in transmural pressure caused by bronchoconstriction in a bronchial tree. Transmural pressures before and during bronchoconstriction were estimated using an integrative computational model of bronchoconstriction. Briefly, this model incorporates a 12-generation symmetric bronchial tree, and the Anafi and Wilson model for the individual airways of the tree. Bronchoconstriction lead to the emergence of VDefs and a relative increase in peak transmural pressures of up to 84% compared to baseline. The highest increase in peak transmural pressure occurred in a central airway outside of VDefs, and the lowest increase was 27% in an airway within VDefs illustrating the heterogeneity in peak transmural pressures within a bronchial tree. Mechanisms contributing to the increase in peak transmural pressures include increased regional ventilation and dynamic hyperinflation both leading to increased alveolar pressures compared to baseline. Pressure differences between intraluminal and alveolar pressure increased driven by the increased airway resistance and its contribution to total transmural pressure reached up to 24%. In conclusion, peak transmural pressure in lungs with VDefs during bronchoconstriction can be substantially increased compared to dilated airways in healthy homogeneous lungs and is highly heterogeneous. Further insights will depend on the experimental studies taking these conditions into account.",0,"Airway Transmural Pressures in an Airway Tree During Bronchoconstriction in Asthma Airway transmural pressure in healthy homogeneous lungs with dilated airways is approximately equal to the difference between intraluminal and pleural pressure.

Bronchoconstriction lead to the emergence of VDefs and a relative increase in peak transmural pressures of up to 84% compared to baseline. The highest increase in peak transmural pressure occurred in a central airway outside of VDefs, and the lowest increase was 27% in an airway within VDefs illustrating the heterogeneity in peak transmural pressures within a bronchial tree. Mechanisms contributing to the increase in peak transmural pressures include increased regional ventilation and dynamic hyperinflation both leading to increased alveolar pressures compared to baseline. Pressure differences between intraluminal and alveolar pressure increased driven by the increased airway resistance and its contribution to total transmural pressure reached up to 24%. In conclusion, peak transmural pressure in lungs with VDefs during bronchoconstriction can be substantially increased compared to dilated airways in healthy homogeneous lungs and is highly heterogeneous. Further insights will depend on the experimental studies taking these conditions into account.",airway transmural pressures in an airway tree during bronchoconstriction in asthma airway transmural pressure in healthy homogeneous lungs with dilated airways is approximately equal to the difference between intraluminal and pleural pressure however bronchoconstriction causes airway narrowing parenchymal distortion dynamic hyperinflation and the emergence of ventilation defects vdefs affecting transmural pressure this study aimed to investigate the changes in transmural pressure caused by bronchoconstriction in a bronchial tree transmural pressures before and during bronchoconstriction were estimated using an integrative computational model of bronchoconstriction briefly this model incorporates a 12generation symmetric bronchial tree and the anafi and wilson model for the individual airways of the tree bronchoconstriction lead to the emergence of vdefs and a relative increase in peak transmural pressures of up to 84 compared to baseline the highest increase in peak transmural pressure occurred in a central airway outside of vdefs and the lowest increase was 27 in an airway within vdefs illustrating the heterogeneity in peak transmural pressures within a bronchial tree mechanisms contributing to the increase in peak transmural pressures include increased regional ventilation and dynamic hyperinflation both leading to increased alveolar pressures compared to baseline pressure differences between intraluminal and alveolar pressure increased driven by the increased airway resistance and its contribution to total transmural pressure reached up to 24 in conclusion peak transmural pressure in lungs with vdefs during bronchoconstriction can be substantially increased compared to dilated airways in healthy homogeneous lungs and is highly heterogeneous further insights will depend on the experimental studies taking these conditions into account,1
"Rotavirus group A genotype circulation patterns across Kenya before and after nationwide vaccine introduction, 2010–2018","BACKGROUND: Kenya introduced the monovalent G1P [8] Rotarix® vaccine into the infant immunization schedule in July 2014. We examined trends in rotavirus group A (RVA) genotype distribution pre- (January 2010–June 2014) and post- (July 2014–December 2018) RVA vaccine introduction. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children aged < 13 years from four surveillance sites across Kenya: Kilifi County Hospital, Tabitha Clinic Nairobi, Lwak Mission Hospital, and Siaya County Referral Hospital (children aged < 5 years only). Samples were screened for RVA using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and VP7 and VP4 genes sequenced to infer genotypes. RESULTS: We genotyped 614 samples in pre-vaccine and 261 in post-vaccine introduction periods. During the pre-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent RVA genotypes were G1P [8] (45.8%), G8P [4] (15.8%), G9P [8] (13.2%), G2P [4] (7.0%) and G3P [6] (3.1%). In the post-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent genotypes were G1P [8] (52.1%), G2P [4] (20.7%) and G3P [8] (16.1%). Predominant genotypes varied by year and site in both pre and post-vaccine periods. Temporal genotype patterns showed an increase in prevalence of vaccine heterotypic genotypes, such as the commonly DS-1-like G2P [4] (7.0 to 20.7%, P < .001) and G3P [8] (1.3 to 16.1%, P < .001) genotypes in the post-vaccine introduction period. Additionally, we observed a decline in prevalence of genotypes G8P [4] (15.8 to 0.4%, P < .001) and G9P [8] (13.2 to 5.4%, P < .001) in the post-vaccine introduction period. Phylogenetic analysis of genotype G1P [8], revealed circulation of strains of lineages G1-I, G1-II and P [8]-1, P [8]-III and P [8]-IV. Considerable genetic diversity was observed between the pre and post-vaccine strains, evidenced by distinct clusters. CONCLUSION: Genotype prevalence varied from before to after vaccine introduction. Such observations emphasize the need for long-term surveillance to monitor vaccine impact. These changes may represent natural secular variation or possible immuno-epidemiological changes arising from the introduction of the vaccine. Full genome sequencing could provide insights into post-vaccine evolutionary pressures and antigenic diversity.",0,"Rotavirus group A genotype circulation patterns across Kenya before and after nationwide vaccine introduction, 2010–2018 BACKGROUND: Kenya introduced the monovalent G1P [8] Rotarix® vaccine into the infant immunization schedule in July 2014.

Nanoengineered targeting strategy for cancer immunotherapy,"Cancer immunotherapy is rapidly changing the paradigm of cancer care and treatment by evoking host immunity to kill cancer cells. As clinical approval of checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., ipilimumab and pembrolizumab) has been accelerated by a dramatic improvement of long-term survival in a small subset of patients compared to conventional chemotherapy, growing interesting research has focused on immunotherapy. However, majority of patients have not benefited from checkpoint therapies that only partially remove the inhibition of T cell functions. Insufficient systemic T cell responses, low immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive environment of tumors, create great challenges on therapeutic efficiency. Nanotechnology can integrate multiple functions within controlled size and shape, and has been explored as a unique avenue for the development of cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we mainly address how nanoengineered vaccines can induce robust T cell responses against tumors, as well as how nanomedicine can remodel the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment to boost antitumor immune responses.",0,"Nanoengineered targeting strategy for cancer immunotherapy Cancer immunotherapy is rapidly changing the paradigm of cancer care and treatment by evoking host immunity to kill cancer cells.

Local immunization program for susceptible-infected-recovered network epidemic model,"The immunization strategies through contact tracing on the susceptible-infected-recovered framework in social networks are modelled to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of information-based vaccination programs with particular focus on the scenario where individuals belonging to a specific set can get vaccinated due to the vaccine shortages and other economic or humanity constraints. By using the block heterogeneous mean-field approach, a series of discrete-time dynamical models is formulated and the condition for epidemic outbreaks can be established which is shown to be not only dependent on the network structure but also closely related to the immunization control parameters. Results show that increasing the immunization strength can effectively raise the epidemic threshold, which is different from the predictions obtained through the susceptible-infected-susceptible network framework, where epidemic threshold is independent of the vaccination strength. Furthermore, a significant decrease of vaccine use to control the infectious disease is observed for the local vaccination strategy, which shows the promising applications of the local immunization programs to disease control while calls for accurate local information during the process of disease outbreak.",0,"Local immunization program for susceptible-infected-recovered network epidemic model The immunization strategies through contact tracing on the susceptible-infected-recovered framework in social networks are modelled to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of information-based vaccination programs with particular focus on the scenario where individuals belonging to a specific set can get vaccinated due to the vaccine shortages and other economic or humanity constraints.

Binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN Promotes ASK-1-Dependent Activation-Induced Apoptosis of Human Dendritic Cells,"During disease progression to AIDS, HIV-1 infected individuals become increasingly immunosuppressed and susceptible to opportunistic infections. It has also been demonstrated that multiple subsets of dendritic cells (DC), including DC-SIGN(+) cells, become significantly depleted in the blood and lymphoid tissues of AIDS patients, which may contribute to the failure in initiating effective host immune responses. The mechanism for DC depletion, however, is unclear. It is also known that vast quantities of viral envelope protein gp120 are shed from maturing HIV-1 virions and form circulating immune complexes in the serum of HIV-1-infected individuals, but the pathological role of gp120 in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism of DC death in chronic HIV-1 infection, in which ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DC to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of activation stimuli. The cultured monocyte-derived DC and also freshly-isolated DC-SIGN(+) blood DC that were exposed to either cross-linked recombinant gp120 or immune-complex gp120 in HIV(+) serum underwent considerable apoptosis after CD40 ligation or exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Furthermore, circulating DC-SIGN(+) DC that were isolated directly from HIV-1(+) individuals had actually been pre-sensitized by serum gp120 for activation-induced exorbitant apoptosis. In all cases the DC apoptosis was substantially inhibited by DC-SIGN blockade. Finally, we showed that accelerated DC apoptosis was a direct consequence of excessive activation of the pro-apoptotic molecule ASK-1 and transfection of siRNA against ASK-1 significantly prevented the activation-induced excessive DC death. Our study discloses a previously unknown mechanism of immune modulation by envelope protein gp120, provides new insights into HIV immunopathogenesis, and suggests potential therapeutic approaches to prevent DC depletion in chronic HIV infection.",0,"Binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN Promotes ASK-1-Dependent Activation-Induced Apoptosis of Human Dendritic Cells During disease progression to AIDS, HIV-1 infected individuals become increasingly immunosuppressed and susceptible to opportunistic infections.

Mucosal Vaccination with Recombinant Lactobacillus casei-Displayed CTA1-Conjugated Consensus Matrix Protein-2 (sM2) Induces Broad Protection against Divergent Influenza Subtypes in BALB/c Mice,"To develop a safe and effective mucosal vaccine against pathogenic influenza viruses, we constructed recombinant Lactobacillus casei strains that express conserved matrix protein 2 with (pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei) or without (pgsA-sM2/L. casei) cholera toxin subunit A1 (CTA1) on the surface. The surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by cellular fractionation analyses, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Oral and nasal inoculations of recombinant L. casei into mice resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA.

"Facilitating Advance Care Planning for Patients With Severe COPD: A Qualitative Study of Experiences and Perceptions of Community Physicians, Nurses, and Allied Health Professionals","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Patients with severe COPD often fail to receive adequate palliative care and are subject to undesired hospital transfers and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although promoting advance care planning (ACP) in the community can help ensure the optimal delivery of palliative care for patients with COPD, the key challenges to routinely implementing ACP are not known. The aim of this study was to identify the perception of healthcare professionals with regard to ACP for adults living with severe COPD and the challenges to facilitating ACP. A multicenter qualitative study design was used. In-depth semistructured interviews were held involving 38 healthcare professionals from 19 institutions in Japan. Text data were analyzed by content analysis. Five main themes capturing the challenges to routine implementation of ACP were identified: daily decision-making; sense of ethical decision-making; in-depth interviewing skills; collaborative information sharing among team members; and knowledge dissemination regarding ACP. The model demonstrates the complexity inherent in ACP facilitation for community-dwelling adults with severe COPD, with all the elements required for successful ACP implementation. We recommend an approach that recognizes the importance of stakeholder education, particularly educating professionals to develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills required for ACP facilitation: in-depth interviewing, collaborative information sharing, and ethical analysis, focusing on decision-making concerning everyday life support.",0,"Facilitating Advance Care Planning for Patients With Severe COPD: A Qualitative Study of Experiences and Perceptions of Community Physicians, Nurses, and Allied Health Professionals Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity worldwide.

Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype,"The Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell (CRFK) is an immortalised cell line derived from the feline kidney that is utilised for the growth of certain vaccinal viruses. Confusion exists as to whether CRFK are epithelial or mesenchymal in phenotype. The aim of this study was to characterise CRFK cells via immunofluorescence, enzyme cytochemistry, western blotting, RT-qPCR for S100A4 and comparison to primary feline proximal tubular epithelial cells (FPTEC) and feline cortical fibroblasts (FCF). CRFK cells were of fusiform morphology and appeared similar to FCF. CRFK expressed the mesenchymal intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin together with two cell adhesion molecules associated with feline fibroblasts (CD29 and CD44), and lacked expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, myogenic IF desmin and endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF). In addition, CRFK did not demonstrate brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC. S100A4 gene expression, implicated in both neoplastic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, was highly upregulated in CRFK in comparison to the primary feline renal cells. CRFK appear phenotypically similar to fibroblasts, rather than tubular epithelial cells, and may have undergone neoplastic transformation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after extensive passaging. This finding may have potential implications for future research utilising this cell line.",0,"Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype The Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell (CRFK) is an immortalised cell line derived from the feline kidney that is utilised for the growth of certain vaccinal viruses.

PLAN-M; Mycobacteriophage Endolysins Fused to Biodegradable Nanobeads Mitigate Mycobacterial Growth in Liquid and on Surfaces,"The Mycobacteria are a genus of Actinobacteria that include human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). Active TB disease can spread by airborne transmission to healthcare workers and to their community. The HHMI SEA-PHAGES program has contributed to discovering bacteriophages that are able to infect M. smegmatis MC(2) 155, a close relative of M. tuberculosis. This collection of diverse Mycobacteriophages is an excellent resource for trialling bacteriophage-sourced enzymes in novel applications. Herein we measured the ability Mycobacteriophage endolysins to lyse their host strain when functionally fused to biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) nanobeads. PHA nanobeads facilitate both the expression and the application of enzymes to surfaces and have been demonstrated to stabilize a wide array of proteins for practical applications whilst eliminating the challenges of traditional protein purification. We selected two Lysin A and six Lysin B homologs to be functionally fused to the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase C (PhaC). Expression of these constructs resulted in functional lysins displayed on the surface of PHA nanobeads. The lysins thus directionally displayed on nanobeads lysed up to 79% of the M. smegmatis MC(2) 155 population using 80 mg/mL of nanobeads in pure culture. In order to determine whether the nanobeads would be effective as a protective layer in PPE we adapted a fabric-based test and observed a maximum of 1 log loss of the cell population after 5 h of exposure on a textile (91% cell lysis). Lysin B enzymes performed better than the Lysin A enzymes as a protective barrier on textiles surface assays. These results suggest that bacterial endolysins are efficient in their action when displayed on PHA nanobeads and can cause significant population mortality in as little as 45 min. Our results provide the proof-of-principle that Mycobacteriophage endolysins can be used on functionalized nanobeads where they can protect surfaces such as personal protective equipment (PPE) that routinely come into contact with aerosolised bacteria.",0,"PLAN-M; Mycobacteriophage Endolysins Fused to Biodegradable Nanobeads Mitigate Mycobacterial Growth in Liquid and on Surfaces The Mycobacteria are a genus of Actinobacteria that include human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB).

Prevalence and Correlation of Infectious Agents in Hospitalized Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Central China,"Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children under the age of 5 years. Almost 2 million children die from ARTIs each year, and most of them are from developing countries. The prevalence and correlation of pathogens in ARTIs are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with ARTIs. A total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. All patients were hospitalized in Wuhan Children’s Hospital between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. Pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen IgM tests. Regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. Our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza B virus were the leading infectious agents. Mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. The most common agents in the co-infections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza B virus. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. The prevalence of infectious agents in children with ARTIs was determined. Equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. This revealed a linear correlation for pathogens in children with ARTIs. This study provides useful information for improving case prevention and management.",0,"Prevalence and Correlation of Infectious Agents in Hospitalized Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Central China Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children under the age of 5 years.

Electrical Characterization of Cellulose-Based Membranes towards Pathogen Detection in Water †,"Paper substrates are promising for development of cost-effective and efficient point-of-care biosensors, essential for public healthcare and environmental diagnostics in emergency situations. Most paper-based biosensors rely on the natural capillarity of paper to perform qualitative or semi-quantitative colorimetric detections. To achieve quantification and better sensitivity, technologies combining paper-based substrates and electrical detection are being developed. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of electrical measurements by means of a simple, parallel-plate electrode setup towards the detection of whole-cell bacteria captured in nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. Unlike current electrical sensors, which are mostly integrated, this plug and play system has reusable electrodes and enables simple and fast bacterial detection through impedance measurements. The characterized NC membrane was subjected to (i) a biofunctionalization, (ii) different saline solutions modelling real water samples, and (iii) bacterial suspensions of different concentrations. Bacterial detection was achieved in low conductivity buffers through both resistive and capacitive changes in the sensed medium. To capture Bacillus thuringiensis, the model microorganism used in this work, the endolysin cell-wall binding domain (CBD) of Deep-Blue, a bacteriophage targeting this bacterium, was integrated into the membranes as a recognition bio-interface. This experimental proof-of-concept illustrates the electrical detection of 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) mL(−1) bacteria in low-salinity buffers within 5 min, using a very simple setup. This offers perspectives for affordable pathogen sensors that can easily be reconfigured for different bacteria. Water quality testing is a particularly interesting application since it requires frequent testing, especially in emergency situations.",0,"Electrical Characterization of Cellulose-Based Membranes towards Pathogen Detection in Water † Paper substrates are promising for development of cost-effective and efficient point-of-care biosensors, essential for public healthcare and environmental diagnostics in emergency situations.

Movement and contact patterns of long-distance free-grazing ducks and avian influenza persistence in Vietnam,"Presence of ducks, and in particular of free-grazing ducks, has consistently been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks which has compromised poultry production in South-East Asia since the early 2000s and continues to threaten public health, farmers’ livelihood and food security. Although free-grazing duck production has been practised for decades in South-East Asia, there are few published studies describing this production system, which is suspected to play an important role in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses. This study aimed at describing quantitatively the long-distance free-grazing duck production system in South Vietnam, characterising the movement and contact patterns of the duck flocks, and identifying potential associations between farming practices, movement and contact patterns and the circulation of avian influenza viruses. We conducted interviews among stakeholders involved in the free-grazing duck production system (duck farmers, transporters and rice paddy owners) in combination with a virological cross-sectional survey in South Vietnam. Results show that both direct and indirect contacts between free-grazing duck flocks were frequent and diverse. The flocks were transported extensively across district and province boundaries, mainly by boat but also by truck or on foot. A third of the investigated flocks had a positive influenza A virology test, indicating current circulation of avian influenza viruses, but none were positive for H5 subtypes. The age and size of the flock as well as its location at the time of sampling were associated with the risk of influenza A circulation in the flocks. These findings should be considered when developing risk assessment models of influenza virus spread aimed at informing the development of improved biosecurity practices leading to enhanced animal health, sustainable animal production and reliable income for farmers.",0,"Movement and contact patterns of long-distance free-grazing ducks and avian influenza persistence in Vietnam Presence of ducks, and in particular of free-grazing ducks, has consistently been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks which has compromised poultry production in South-East Asia since the early 2000s and continues to threaten public health, farmers’ livelihood and food security.

Identification and characterization of adipose surface epitopes,"Adipose tissue is a central regulator of metabolism and an important pharmacological target to treat the metabolic consequences of obesity, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Among the various cellular compartments, the adipocyte cell surface is especially appealing as a drug target as it contains various proteins that when activated or inhibited promote adipocyte health, change its endocrine function and eventually maintain or restore whole-body insulin sensitivity. In addition, cell surface proteins are readily accessible by various drug classes. However, targeting individual cell surface proteins in adipocytes has been difficult due to important functions of these proteins outside adipose tissue, raising various safety concerns. Thus, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of adipose selective surface proteins and/or targeting reagents. Here, we discuss several receptor families with an important function in adipogenesis and mature adipocytes to highlight the complexity at the cell surface and illustrate the problems with identifying adipose selective proteins. We then discuss that, while no unique adipocyte surface protein might exist, how splicing, posttranslational modifications as well as protein/protein interactions can create enormous diversity at the cell surface that vastly expands the space of potentially unique epitopes and how these selective epitopes can be identified and targeted.",0,"Identification and characterization of adipose surface epitopes Adipose tissue is a central regulator of metabolism and an important pharmacological target to treat the metabolic consequences of obesity, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.

Production and characterization of human anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies from the cells of HIV-1 infected Indian donors,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed from HIV-1 infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. The third variable region (V3) is a crucial target on gp120, primarily due to its involvement in co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) binding and presence of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: Thirty-three HIV-1 seropositive drug naive patients (18 males and 15 females) within the age range of 20–57 years (median = 33 years) were recruited in this study for mAb production. The mAbs were selected from EBV transformed cultures with conformationally constrained Cholera-toxin-B containing V3C (V3C-CTB) fusion protein. We tested the mAbs for their binding with HIV-1 derived proteins and peptides by ELISA and for neutralization against HIV-1 viruses by TZM-bl assays. RESULTS: We isolated three anti-V3 mAbs, 277, 903 and 904 from the cells of different individuals. The ELISA binding revealed a subtype-C and subtype-A specific binding of antibody 277 and 903 while mAb 904 exhibited cross reactivity also with subtype-B V3. Epitope mapping of mAbs with overlapping V3 peptides showed exclusive binding to V3 crown. The antibodies displayed high and low neutralizing activity against 2/5 tier 1 and 1/6 tier 2 viruses respectively. Overall, we observed a resistance of the tier 2 viruses to neutralization by the anti-V3 mAbs, despite the exposure of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on two representative native viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL), suggesting that the affinity of mAb might equally be crucial for neutralization, as the epitope recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the anti-V3 antibodies derived from subtype-C infected Indian patients display neutralization potential against tier 1 viruses while such activity may be limited against more resistant tier 2 viruses. Defining the fine epitope specificities of these mAbs and further experimental manipulations will be helpful in identification of epitopes, unique to clade C or shared with non-clade C viruses, in context of V3 region.",0,"Production and characterization of human anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies from the cells of HIV-1 infected Indian donors BACKGROUND: Analysis of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed from HIV-1 infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.

Defining the fine epitope specificities of these mAbs and further experimental manipulations will be helpful in identification of epitopes, unique to clade C or shared with non-clade C viruses, in context of V3 region.",production and characterization of human antiv3 monoclonal antibodies from the cells of hiv1 infected indian donors background analysis of human monoclonal antibodies mabs developed from hiv1 infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes on the hiv1 envelope glycoprotein the third variable region v3 is a crucial target on gp120 primarily due to its involvement in coreceptor cxcr4 or ccr5 binding and presence of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies methods thirtythree hiv1 seropositive drug naive patients 18 males and 15 females within the age range of 2057 years median  33 years were recruited in this study for mab production the mabs were selected from ebv transformed cultures with conformationally constrained choleratoxinb containing v3c v3cctb fusion protein we tested the mabs for their binding with hiv1 derived proteins and peptides by elisa and for neutralization against hiv1 viruses by tzmbl assays results we isolated three antiv3 mabs 277 903 and 904 from the cells of different individuals the elisa binding revealed a subtypec and subtypea specific binding of antibody 277 and 903 while mab 904 exhibited cross reactivity also with subtypeb v3 epitope mapping of mabs with overlapping v3 peptides showed exclusive binding to v3 crown the antibodies displayed high and low neutralizing activity against 25 tier 1 and 16 tier 2 viruses respectively overall we observed a resistance of the tier 2 viruses to neutralization by the antiv3 mabs despite the exposure of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on two representative native viruses du15612 and jrfl suggesting that the affinity of mab might equally be crucial for neutralization as the epitope recognition conclusions our study suggests that the antiv3 antibodies derived from subtypec infected indian patients display neutralization potential against tier 1 viruses while such activity may be limited against more resistant tier 2 viruses defining the fine epitope specificities of these mabs and further experimental manipulations will be helpful in identification of epitopes unique to clade c or shared with nonclade c viruses in context of v3 region,1
Evaluation of free or liposome-encapsulated ribavirin for antiviral therapy of experimentally induced feline infectious peritonitis,"Ribavirin, either free in aqueous solution or incorporated into liposomes, was evaluated in 50 specific-pathogen-free kittens after experimental challenge exposure with feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv). Ribavirin was administered daily for 10 to 14 days at 16·5 mg kg(−1) bodyweight given per os, intramuscularly or intravenously beginning 18 hours after kittens were challenge-exposed with fipv. All kittens, including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens, succumbed to FIP. Clinical signs of disease were more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened. The clinical efficacy of free ribavirin given intravenously at a reduced dosage (5·5 mg kg(−1) bodyweight) was compared to that of ribavirin incorporated into lecithin-containing liposomes (5 mg kg(−1)) intravenously. Drugs were given once daily for three consecutive days of each week for three weeks, beginning 18 hours after virus challenge exposure. There was no significant difference either in survival rate or severity of disease between kittens given free ribavirin, liposomal ribavirin or saline only. Because of its intrinsic toxicity and low therapeutic index against fipv and its marginal antiviral activities in vivo at maximal doses, ribavirin cannot presently be recommended as primary antiviral chemotherapy against fip.",0,"Evaluation of free or liposome-encapsulated ribavirin for antiviral therapy of experimentally induced feline infectious peritonitis Ribavirin, either free in aqueous solution or incorporated into liposomes, was evaluated in 50 specific-pathogen-free kittens after experimental challenge exposure with feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv).

Handoff Communication between Remote Healthcare Facilities,"INTRODUCTION: Handoffs and transitions of care are common weak points in healthcare provider communication as patients move between sites. With no consistent pattern of communication between St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude) and its affiliated clinics, the Affiliate Program Office at St. Jude developed and implemented a standardized communication tool to facilitate patient transitions between different healthcare sites. METHODS: Each team of providers created flow diagrams to define the current state of communication when patients were transitioning between remote sites. Fishbone diagrams identified the common barriers to effective communication as a lack of consistent communication and ownership. We developed a communication tool to address these barriers, which was disseminated by secure email. We measured the percent usage of the completed hand-off tool before a patient transitioned, staff experience, and the number of errors. RESULTS: The time to send or receive the communication bundle was <10 minutes. Within 3 months of implementing the SMART bundle at 3 pilot sites, the bundle was used completely in 6 of 8 patient transitions and was associated with somewhat improved staff satisfaction. We identified no adverse events related to the communication bundle. CONCLUSIONS: In this small pilot study, we accomplished closed-loop communication between geographically remote healthcare sites by using an electronically transmitted standardized communication bundle.",0,"Handoff Communication between Remote Healthcare Facilities INTRODUCTION: Handoffs and transitions of care are common weak points in healthcare provider communication as patients move between sites.

Industrial Food Animal Production and Global Health Risks: Exploring the Ecosystems and Economics of Avian Influenza,"Many emerging infectious diseases in human populations are associated with zoonotic origins. Attention has often focused on wild animal reservoirs, but most zoonotic pathogens of recent concern to human health either originate in, or are transferred to, human populations from domesticated animals raised for human consumption. Thus, the ecological context of emerging infectious disease comprises two overlapping ecosystems: the natural habitats and populations of wild animals, and the anthropogenically controlled habitats and populations of domesticated species. Intensive food animal production systems and their associated value chains dominate in developed countries and are increasingly important in developing countries. These systems are characterized by large numbers of animals being raised in confinement with high throughput and rapid turnover. Although not typically recognized as such, industrial food animal production generates unique ecosystems—environments that may facilitate the evolution of zoonotic pathogens and their transmission to human populations. It is often assumed that confined food animal production reduces risks of emerging zoonotic diseases. This article provides evidence suggesting that these industrial systems may increase animal and public health risks unless there is recognition of the specific biosecurity and biocontainment challenges of the industrial model. Moreover, the economic drivers and constraints faced by the industry and its participants must be fully understood in order to inform preventative policy. In order to more effectively reduce zoonotic disease risk from industrial food animal production, private incentives for the implementation of biosecurity must align with public health interests.",0,"Industrial Food Animal Production and Global Health Risks: Exploring the Ecosystems and Economics of Avian Influenza Many emerging infectious diseases in human populations are associated with zoonotic origins.

Risk factors for severe acute lower respiratory infections in children – a systematic review and meta-analysis,"AIM: To identify the risk factors in children under five years of age for severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), which are the leading cause of child mortality. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published literature available in the public domain. We conducted a quality assessment of all eligible studies according to GRADE criteria and performed a meta-analysis to report the odds ratios for all risk factors identified in these studies. RESULTS: We identified 36 studies that investigated 19 risk factors for severe ALRI. Of these, 7 risk factors were significantly associated with severe ALRI in a consistent manner across studies, with the following meta-analysis estimates of odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals): low birth weight 3.18 (1.02-9.90), lack of exclusive breastfeeding 2.34 (1.42-3.88), crowding – more than 7 persons per household 1.96 (1.53-2.52), exposure to indoor air pollution 1.57 (1.06-2.31), incomplete immunization 1.83 (1.32-2.52), undernutrition – weight-for-age less than 2 standard deviations 4.47 (2.10-9.49), and HIV infection 4.15 (2.57-9.74). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the role of the above seven risk factors in the development of severe pneumonia in under-five children. In addition, it emphasizes the need for further studies investigating other potential risk factors. Since these risk factors are potentially preventable, health policies targeted at reducing their prevalence provide a basis for decreasing the burden of childhood pneumonia.",0,"Risk factors for severe acute lower respiratory infections in children – a systematic review and meta-analysis AIM: To identify the risk factors in children under five years of age for severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), which are the leading cause of child mortality.

Experimental infection of H5N1 HPAI in BALB/c mice,"BACKGROUND: In 2005 huge epizooty of H5N1 HPAI occurred in Russia. It had been clear that territory of Russia becoming endemic for H5N1 HPAI. In 2006 several outbreaks have occurred. To develop new vaccines and antiviral therapies, animal models had to be investigated. We choose highly pathogenic strain for these studies. RESULTS: A/duck/Tuva/01/06 belongs to Quinghai-like group viruses. Molecular markers – cleavage site, K627 in PB2 characterize this virus as highly pathogenic. This data was confirmed by direct pathogenic tests: IVPI = 3.0, MLD(50 )= 1,4Log10EID(50). Also molecular analysis showed sensivity of the virus to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. Serological analysis showed wide cross-reactivity of this virus with sera produced to H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated earlier in South-East Asia. Mean time to death of infected animals was 8,19+/-0,18 days. First time acute delayed hemorrhagic syndrome was observed in mice lethal model. Hypercytokinemia was determined by elevated sera levels of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-10.

Low acclimation capacity of narrow‐ranging thermal specialists exposes susceptibility to global climate change,"Thermal acclimation is hypothesized to offer a selective advantage in seasonal habitats and may underlie disparities in geographic range size among closely‐related species with similar ecologies. Understanding this relationship is also critical for identifying species that are more sensitive to warming climates. Here, we study North American plethodontid salamanders to investigate whether acclimation ability is associated with species’ latitudinal extents and the thermal range of the environments they inhabit. We quantified variation in thermal physiology by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) at different test and acclimation temperatures for 16 species of salamanders with varying latitudinal extents. A phylogenetically‐controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) was then employed to determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide‐ and narrow‐ranging species at different acclimation temperatures. In addition, we tested for a relationship between the acclimation ability of species and the environmental temperature ranges they inhabit. Further, we investigated if there is a trade‐off between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and thermal acclimation ability. MCMCglmm results show a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrow‐ranging temperate salamanders. Salamanders with wide latitudinal distributions maintain or slightly increase SMR when subjected to higher test and acclimation temperatures, whereas several narrow‐ranging species show significant metabolic depression. We also found significant, positive relationships between acclimation ability and environmental thermal range, and between acclimation ability and CTMax. Wide‐ranging salamander species exhibit a greater capacity for thermal acclimation than narrow‐ranging species, suggesting that selection for acclimation ability may have been a key factor enabling geographic expansion into areas with greater thermal variability. Further, given that narrow‐ranging salamanders are found to have both poor acclimation ability and lower tolerance to warm temperatures, they are likely to be more susceptible to environmental warming associated with anthropogenic climate change.",0,"Low acclimation capacity of narrow‐ranging thermal specialists exposes susceptibility to global climate change Thermal acclimation is hypothesized to offer a selective advantage in seasonal habitats and may underlie disparities in geographic range size among closely‐related species with similar ecologies.

Successful respiratory management of a Marshall-Smith syndrome patient with a tracheo-innominate artery fistula,"BACKGROUND: Tracheo-innominate artery fistula (TIF) is a life-threatening complication of tracheostomy. We describe perioperative management for innominate artery transection in a case with TIF. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old Japanese female with Marshal-Smith syndrome presented for management of TIF. She underwent tracheostomy at the age of 3 months and an uncuffed tracheostomy tube was inserted. One month before admission to our hospital, intermittent tracheal bleeding, suggesting TIF, occurred. Although we considered to change to a cuffed endotracheal tube, craniofacial abnormality suggested difficult oral intubation, and there was a possibility of rebleeding. Finally, innominate artery transection was performed under total intravenous anesthesia without changing the tracheostomy tube. Surgery completed uneventfully and she received mechanical ventilation under sedation for a day, followed by weaning without complications. CONCLUSIONS: A cuffed tracheostomy tube should have been inserted before surgery for effective hemostasis against sudden bleeding from TIF even though conversion to oral intubation was difficult.",0,"Successful respiratory management of a Marshall-Smith syndrome patient with a tracheo-innominate artery fistula BACKGROUND: Tracheo-innominate artery fistula (TIF) is a life-threatening complication of tracheostomy.

Design and Synthesis of Multi-Functional Superparamagnetic Core-Gold Shell Nanoparticles Coated with Chitosan and Folate for Targeted Antitumor Therapy,"A dual-targeting nanomedicine composed of pH-sensitive superparamagnetic iron oxide core-gold shell SPION@Au, chitosan (CS), and folate (FA) was developed as a doxorubicin (DOX) antitumor medication. Microemulsion was used for preparation and cross-linking conjugation. The characteristics of the designed nanocomposite were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, UV-visible spectroscopy, Zeta potential and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The prepared SPION@Au-CS-DOX-FA nanoparticles (NPs) were spherical with an average diameter of 102.6 ± 7 nm and displayed an elevated drug loading behavior and sustained drug release capacity. The SPION@Au-CS-DOX-FA NPs revealed long term anti-cancer efficacy due to their cytotoxic effect and apoptotic inducing efficiency in SkBr3 cell lines. Additionally, Real-time PCR outcomes significantly showed an increase in BAK and BAX expression and a decrease in BCL-XL and BCL-2. In vivo results revealed that SPION@Au significantly decreased the tumor size in treated mice through magnetization.

However, vaccine-derived herd immunity may be short-lived due to interactions between human mobility and imperfect or waning vaccine efficacy. As the supply and utilization of oral cholera vaccines grows, critical questions related to herd immunity are emerging, including: who should be targeted; when should revaccination be performed; and why have cholera outbreaks occurred in recently vaccinated populations? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use mathematical models to simulate routine and mass oral cholera vaccination in populations with varying degrees of migration, transmission intensity, and vaccine coverage. We show that migration and waning vaccine efficacy strongly influence the duration of herd immunity while birth and death rates have relatively minimal impacts. As compared to either periodic mass vaccination or routine vaccination alone, a community could be protected longer by a blended “Mass and Maintain” strategy. We show that vaccination may be best targeted at populations with intermediate degrees of mobility as compared to communities with very high or very low population turnover. Using a case study of an internally displaced person camp in South Sudan which underwent high-coverage mass vaccination in 2014 and 2015, we show that waning vaccine direct effects and high population turnover rendered the camp over 80% susceptible at the time of the cholera outbreak beginning in October 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Oral cholera vaccines can be powerful tools for quickly protecting a population for a period of time that depends critically on vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy over time, and the rate of population turnover through human mobility. Due to waning herd immunity, epidemics in vaccinated communities are possible but become less likely through complementary interventions or data-driven revaccination strategies.",0,"Prolonging herd immunity to cholera via vaccination: Accounting for human mobility and waning vaccine effects BACKGROUND: Oral cholera vaccination is an approach to preventing outbreaks in at-risk settings and controlling cholera in endemic settings.

Coumarin carbonic anhydrase inhibitors from natural sources,"Coumarins constitute a relatively new class of inhibitors of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), possessing a unique inhibition mechanism, acting as “prodrug inhibitors.” They undergo the hydrolysis of the lactone ring mediated by the esterase activity of CA. The formed 2-hydroxy-cinnamic acids thereafter bind within a very particular part of the enzyme active site, at its entrance, where a high variability of amino acid residues among the different mammalian CA isoforms is present, and where other inhibitors classes were not seen bound earlier. This explains why coumarins are among the most isoform-selective CA inhibitors known to date among the many chemotypes endowed with such biological activity. As coumarins are widespread secondary metabolites in some bacteria, plants, fungi, and ascidians, many such compounds from various natural sources have been investigated for their CA inhibitory properties and for possible biomedical applications, mainly as anticancer agents targeting hypoxic tumours.",0,"Coumarin carbonic anhydrase inhibitors from natural sources Coumarins constitute a relatively new class of inhibitors of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), possessing a unique inhibition mechanism, acting as “prodrug inhibitors.” They undergo the hydrolysis of the lactone ring mediated by the esterase activity of CA.

Post-Exposure Prophylaxis With Ribavirin Plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Healthcare Workers,"BACKGROUND: In 2015, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred in South Korea involving 186 patients, 39 of whom were healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to the infection. An effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy may limit the spread of infection; however, there is no consensus regarding PEP for MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed (1) the efficacy of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP for HCWs exposed to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia, and (2) safety of the PEP regimen. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 43 HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS-CoV from 5 hospitals affected during this outbreak in South Korea. The rate of MERS-CoV infection was compared between 22 workers at 1 hospital who received PEP consisting of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir after exposure to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia and 21 workers at other hospitals who did not receive PEP. RESULTS: Six workers (14%) developed MERS-CoV infection; all of these subjects belonged to the non-PEP group. The attack rate was lower in the PEP group compared with the non-PEP group (0% vs. 28.6%; Odds ratio = 0.405, 95% confidence interval = 0.274–0.599; P = 0.009). The most commonly reported side effects of PEP therapy were nausea and diarrhea, but there were no severe adverse effects associated with PEP therapy. CONCLUSION: PEP with a combination of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir appears to be effective and generally safe for preventing MERS-CoV infection after high-risk exposure in healthcare workers.

Rural Youth Violence: It Is a Public Health Concern!,"Youth violence is a significant issue for public health because of the potential for longterm impacts on individuals, families and communities. Limited exposure to violence is seen as a component of healthy living. However, there is limited understanding of violence from a public health perspective within rural communities. Rural refers to those communities with a population less than 10,000 outside the main commuting zone of a large urban area. Population health approaches, including the social determinants of health, are well supported by public health officials. Generating information about rural youth violence from a Canadian perspective would add to our understanding of these social determinants while providing guidance for policy and program development. Current understandings of youth violence are limited to an urban, and oftentimes, American perspective. An ongoing two-phase Canadian study on rural youth violence included qualitative interviews with 52 youth and the completion of a questionnaire that had been developed from the qualitative responses. The questionnaire has been completed by a larger sample of rural youth. The findings generated from this ongoing study will be useful in linking violence with social factors that impact health and thereby guide population health programs and policies.

"The behavioral, cellular and immune mediators of HIV-1 acquisition: New insights from population genetics","Millions are exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) every year, but not all acquire the virus, suggesting a potential role for host genetics in the moderation of HIV-1 acquisition. Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28–42% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV–1 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.",0,"The behavioral, cellular and immune mediators of HIV-1 acquisition: New insights from population genetics Millions are exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) every year, but not all acquire the virus, suggesting a potential role for host genetics in the moderation of HIV-1 acquisition.

Microglia Play a Major Role in Direct Viral-Induced Demyelination,"Microglia are the resident macrophage-like populations in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia remain quiescent, unable to perform effector and antigen presentation (APC) functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that microglia can be persistently infected by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis with subsequent axonal loss, and demyelination and serve as a virus-induced model of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Current studies revealed that MHV infection is associated with the pronounced activation of microglia during acute inflammation, as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of microglia-specific proteins, Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), which is a macrophage/microglia-specific novel calcium-binding protein and involved in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis. During chronic inflammation (day 30 postinfection), microglia were still present within areas of demyelination. Experiments performed in ex vivo spinal cord slice culture and in vitro neonatal microglial culture confirmed direct microglial infection. Our results suggest that MHV can directly infect and activate microglia during acute inflammation, which in turn during chronic inflammation stage causes phagocytosis of myelin sheath leading to chronic inflammatory demyelination.",0,"Microglia Play a Major Role in Direct Viral-Induced Demyelination Microglia are the resident macrophage-like populations in the central nervous system (CNS).

A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment,"The use of antiviral drugs has been recognized as the primary public health strategy for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic strain. However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy.",0,"A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment The use of antiviral drugs has been recognized as the primary public health strategy for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic strain.

An unique CD4(+)CD8(+) intestinal intraepithelial Lymphocyte Specific for DnaK (Escherichia coli HSP70) may be selected by intestinal microflora of rats,"We have previously shown an age-associated increase in unique CD4+CD8+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (i-IEL) in rats. To elucidate the potential causes of the increase in CD4+CD8+ i-IEL with age, we analyzed the specificity of the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL and influence of intestinal microflora on the increase in this subset in aged rats. The purified CD4+CD8+ i-IEL proliferated in response to DnaK [Escherichia colt (E. coli) HSP70] in the presence of mitomycin-c (MMC)-treated syngeneic, spleen cells. The proportion of CD4+CD8+ T cells in whole i-IEL were significantly increased in aged rats fed commercial (CL-2) diet but not in those fed home-made (purified) diet under conventional condition.

Global mapping of randomised trials related articles published in high-impact-factor medical journals: a cross-sectional analysis,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the most reliable information to inform clinical practice and patient care. We aimed to map global clinical research publication activity through RCT-related articles in high-impact-factor medical journals over the past five decades. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of articles published in the highest ranked medical journals with an impact factor > 10 (according to Journal Citation Reports published in 2017). We searched PubMed/MEDLINE (from inception to December 31, 2017) for all RCT-related articles (e.g. primary RCTs, secondary analyses and methodology papers) published in high-impact-factor medical journals. For each included article, raw metadata were abstracted from the Web of Science. A process of standardization was conducted to unify the different terms and grammatical variants and to remove typographical, transcription and/or indexing errors. Descriptive analyses were conducted (including the number of articles, citations, most prolific authors, countries, journals, funding sources and keywords). Network analyses of collaborations between countries and co-words are presented. RESULTS: We included 39,305 articles (for the period 1965–2017) published in forty journals. The Lancet (n = 3593; 9.1%), the Journal of Clinical Oncology (n = 3343; 8.5%) and The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 3275 articles; 8.3%) published the largest number of RCTs. A total of 154 countries were involved in the production of articles. The global productivity ranking was led by the United States (n = 18,393 articles), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 8028 articles), Canada (n = 4548 articles) and Germany (n = 4415 articles). Seventeen authors who had published 100 or more articles were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Duke University (United States), Harvard University (United States) and McMaster University (Canada). The main funding institutions were the National Institutes of Health (United States), Hoffmann-La Roche (Switzerland), Pfizer (United States), Merck Sharp & Dohme (United States) and Novartis (Switzerland). The 100 most cited RCTs were published in nine journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 78 articles), The Lancet (n = 9 articles) and JAMA (n = 7 articles). These landmark contributions focused on novel methodological approaches (e.g. the “Bland-Altman method”) and trials on the management of chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes control, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, multiple therapies for diverse cancers, cardiovascular therapies such as lipid-lowering statins, antihypertensive medications, and antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis identified authors, countries, funding institutions, landmark contributions and high-impact-factor medical journals publishing RCTs.

Online adaptive radiotherapy compared to plan selection for rectal cancer: quantifying the benefit,"BACKGROUND: To compare online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy (PS) with respect to dose to the organs at risk (OAR) for rectal cancer. METHODS: The first 20 patients treated with PS between May–September 2016 were included. This resulted in 10 short (SCRT) and 10 long (LCRT) course radiotherapy treatment schedules with a total of 300 Conebeam CT scans (CBCT). New dual arc VMAT plans were generated using auto-planning for both the online ART and PS strategy. For each fraction bowel bag, bladder and mesorectum were delineated on daily Conebeam CTs. The dose distribution planned was used to calculate daily DVHs. Coverage of the CTV was calculated, as defined by the dose received by 99% of the CTV volume (D99%). The volume of normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed fraction dose was calculated by calculating the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed fraction or more dose minus the volume of the CTV. For each fraction the difference between the plan selection and online adaptive strategy of each DVH parameter was calculated, as well as the average difference per patient. RESULTS: Target coverage remained the same for online ART. The median volume of the normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed dose dropped from 642 cm3 (PS) to 237 cm3 (online-ART)(p < 0.001). Online ART reduced dose to the OARs for all tested dose levels for SCRT and LCRT (p < 0.001). For V15Gy of the bowel bag the median difference over all fractions of all patients was − 126 cm(3) in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 206 cm(3) to − 40 cm(3). For SCRT the median difference was − 62 cm(3), while the range of the average difference per patient was − 105 cm3 to − 51 cm(3). For V15Gy of the bladder the median difference over all fractions of all patients was 26% in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 34 to 12%. For SCRT the median difference of V95% was − 8%, while the range of the average difference per patient was − 29 to 0%.

Islands of linkage in an ocean of pervasive recombination reveals two-speed evolution of human cytomegalovirus genomes,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects most of the population worldwide, persisting throughout the host's life in a latent state with periodic episodes of reactivation. While typically asymptomatic, HCMV can cause fatal disease among congenitally infected infants and immunocompromised patients. These clinical issues are compounded by the emergence of antiviral resistance and the absence of an effective vaccine, the development of which is likely complicated by the numerous immune evasins encoded by HCMV to counter the host's adaptive immune responses, a feature that facilitates frequent super-infections. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HCMV is essential for the development of effective new drugs and vaccines. By comparing viral genomes from uncultivated or low-passaged clinical samples of diverse origins, we observe evidence of frequent homologous recombination events, both recent and ancient, and no structure of HCMV genetic diversity at the whole-genome scale. Analysis of individual gene-scale loci reveals a striking dichotomy: while most of the genome is highly conserved, recombines essentially freely and has evolved under purifying selection, 21 genes display extreme diversity, structured into distinct genotypes that do not recombine with each other. Most of these hyper-variable genes encode glycoproteins involved in cell entry or escape of host immunity. Evidence that half of them have diverged through episodes of intense positive selection suggests that rapid evolution of hyper-variable loci is likely driven by interactions with host immunity. It appears that this process is enabled by recombination unlinking hyper-variable loci from strongly constrained neighboring sites. It is conceivable that viral mechanisms facilitating super-infection have evolved to promote recombination between diverged genotypes, allowing the virus to continuously diversify at key loci to escape immune detection, while maintaining a genome optimally adapted to its asymptomatic infectious lifecycle.",0,"Islands of linkage in an ocean of pervasive recombination reveals two-speed evolution of human cytomegalovirus genomes Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects most of the population worldwide, persisting throughout the host's life in a latent state with periodic episodes of reactivation.

Spatial expansions and travelling waves of rabies in vampire bats,"A major obstacle to anticipating the cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases and developing novel strategies for their control is the scarcity of data informing how these pathogens circulate within natural reservoir populations. Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs.",0,"Spatial expansions and travelling waves of rabies in vampire bats A major obstacle to anticipating the cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases and developing novel strategies for their control is the scarcity of data informing how these pathogens circulate within natural reservoir populations.

Accounting for behavioral responses during a flu epidemic using home television viewing,"BACKGROUND: Theory suggests that individual behavioral responses impact the spread of flu-like illnesses, but this has been difficult to empirically characterize. Social distancing is an important component of behavioral response, though analyses have been limited by a lack of behavioral data. Our objective is to use media data to characterize social distancing behavior in order to empirically inform explanatory and predictive epidemiological models. METHODS: We use data on variation in home television viewing as a proxy for variation in time spent in the home and, by extension, contact. This behavioral proxy is imperfect but appealing since information on a rich and representative sample is collected using consistent techniques across time and most major cities. We study the April-May 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 in Central Mexico and examine the dynamic behavioral response in aggregate and contrast the observed patterns of various demographic subgroups. We develop and calibrate a dynamic behavioral model of disease transmission informed by the proxy data on daily variation in contact rates and compare it to a standard (non-adaptive) model and a fixed effects model that crudely captures behavior. RESULTS: We find that after a demonstrable initial behavioral response (consistent with social distancing) at the onset of the outbreak, there was attenuation in the response before the conclusion of the public health intervention. We find substantial differences in the behavioral response across age subgroups and socioeconomic levels. We also find that the dynamic behavioral and fixed effects transmission models better account for variation in new confirmed cases, generate more stable estimates of the baseline rate of transmission over time and predict the number of new cases over a short horizon with substantially less error. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that A/H1N1 had an innate transmission potential greater than previously thought but this was masked by behavioral responses. Observed differences in behavioral response across demographic groups indicate a potential benefit from targeting social distancing outreach efforts.",0,"Accounting for behavioral responses during a flu epidemic using home television viewing BACKGROUND: Theory suggests that individual behavioral responses impact the spread of flu-like illnesses, but this has been difficult to empirically characterize.

Digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics,"When confronted with a globally spreading epidemic, we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination, creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale. Propagating along similar networks, e.g., air-transportation, the spreading dynamics of the supply vs. the demand are, however, fundamentally different, with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics, and the drugs by commodity flow. We show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns: while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations, creating a concurrent global demand, commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread, in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied, while the majority remains deprived. Consequently, even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities, due to the inherent heterogeneity of network-based commodity flow, efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable, as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply. Therefore, we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy, based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics, that, in effect, bypasses the existing distribution networks. Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.",0,"Digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics When confronted with a globally spreading epidemic, we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination, creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale.

We show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns: while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations, creating a concurrent global demand, commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread, in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied, while the majority remains deprived. Consequently, even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities, due to the inherent heterogeneity of network-based commodity flow, efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable, as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply. Therefore, we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy, based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics, that, in effect, bypasses the existing distribution networks. Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.",digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics when confronted with a globally spreading epidemic we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale propagating along similar networks eg airtransportation the spreading dynamics of the supply vs the demand are however fundamentally different with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics and the drugs by commodity flow we show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations creating a concurrent global demand commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied while the majority remains deprived consequently even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities due to the inherent heterogeneity of networkbased commodity flow efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply therefore we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics that in effect bypasses the existing distribution networks such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics based on eg short dna sequences or printable chemical compounds that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via dna3d printing technology we test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative saving many more lives with significantly less resources,1
The Role of Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) are characterized by an inflammatory response, alveolar edema, and hypoxemia. ARDS occurs most often in the settings of pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, or severe trauma. The prevalence of ARDS is approximately 10% in patients of intensive care. There is no effective remedy with mortality high at 30–40%. Most functional proteins are dynamic and stringently governed by ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. Protein ubiquitination is reversible, the covalently attached monoubiquitin or polyubiquitin moieties within the targeted protein can be removed by a group of enzymes called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Deubiquitination plays an important role in the pathobiology of ALI/ARDS as it regulates proteins critical in engagement of the alveolo-capillary barrier and in the inflammatory response. In this review, we provide an overview of how DUBs emerge in pathogen-induced pulmonary inflammation and related aspects in ALI/ARDS. Better understanding of deubiquitination-relatedsignaling may lead to novel therapeutic approaches by targeting specific elements of the deubiquitination pathways.",0,"The Role of Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) are characterized by an inflammatory response, alveolar edema, and hypoxemia.

Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins through Dynamic Interactions,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are over-represented in major disease pathways and have attracted significant interest in understanding if and how they may be targeted using small molecules for therapeutic purposes. While most existing studies have focused on extending the traditional structure-centric drug design strategies and emphasized exploring pre-existing structure features of IDPs for specific binding, several examples have also emerged to suggest that small molecules could achieve specificity in binding IDPs and affect their function through dynamic and transient interactions. These dynamic interactions can modulate the disordered conformational ensemble and often lead to modest compaction to shield functionally important interaction sites. Much work remains to be done on further elucidation of the molecular basis of the dynamic small molecule–IDP interaction and determining how it can be exploited for targeting IDPs in practice. These efforts will rely critically on an integrated experimental and computational framework for disordered protein ensemble characterization. In particular, exciting advances have been made in recent years in enhanced sampling techniques, Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-computing, and protein force field optimization, which have now allowed rigorous physics-based atomistic simulations to generate reliable structure ensembles for nontrivial IDPs of modest sizes. Such de novo atomistic simulations will play crucial roles in exploring the exciting opportunity of targeting IDPs through dynamic interactions.",0,"Targeting Intrinsically Disordered Proteins through Dynamic Interactions Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are over-represented in major disease pathways and have attracted significant interest in understanding if and how they may be targeted using small molecules for therapeutic purposes.

Genome-wide screening of lipoproteins in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae identifies three antigens that confer protection against virulent challenge,"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is an important veterinary pathogen that causes porcine pleuropneumonia. Lipoproteins of bacterial pathogens play pleiotropic roles in the infection process. In addition, many bacterial lipoproteins are antigenic and immunoprotective. Therefore, characterization of lipoproteins is a promising strategy for identification of novel vaccine candidates or diagnostic markers. We cloned 58 lipoproteins from A. pleuropneumoniae JL03 (serovar 3) and expressed them in Escherichia coli. Five proteins with strong positive signals in western blotting analysis were used to immunize mice. These proteins elicited significant antibody responses, and three of them (APJL_0922, APJL_1380 and APJL_1976) generated efficient immunoprotection in mice against lethal heterologous challenge with A. pleuropneumoniae 4074 (serovar 1), both in the active and passive immunization assays. Then immunogenicity of these three lipoproteins (APJL_0922, APJL_1380 and APJL_1976) were further tested in pigs. Results showed that these proteins elicited considerable humoral immune responses and effective protective immunity against virulent A. pleuropneumoniae challenge. Our findings suggest that these three novel lipoproteins could be potential subunit vaccine candidates.",0,"Genome-wide screening of lipoproteins in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae identifies three antigens that confer protection against virulent challenge Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is an important veterinary pathogen that causes porcine pleuropneumonia.
